‚ÄúI trust you!‚Äù
The three magical words.
Spread this magic in 2023, for others.

For your own self!"

It‚Äôs convenience.

Bonus:
The only thing that matters in the world is your opinion about your own self."
473,2022-12-16 04:40:46+00:00,warikoo,"19. If your parents are not rich, but you got a good education, be grateful for their sacrifices.

20. A truly happy person will never troll anyone.

21. The face can be misleading. Fall in love with the mind."
474,2022-12-16 04:40:45+00:00,warikoo,"15. True growth lies in doing the boring things over and over again.

16. When in doubt don't ask what should I do. Instead ask what do I WANT to do. Solve for making that happen.

17. If you aren't happy doing it, why are you still in it?

18. Focus on effort, not results."
475,2022-12-16 04:40:45+00:00,warikoo,"12. The day you stop asking 'when should I do it', is the day you are ready to do it.

13. We all have two money lives. The second one begins when we realize we have enough money for our life.

14. If you say the truth, you do not have to remember what you said to whom."
476,2022-12-16 04:40:44+00:00,warikoo,"8. The hardest thing is to focus. The easiest thing is to complain.

9. You will free yourself the day you forgive your parents and stop blaming them.

10. The more available you are, the less respected you'd be.

11. If you truly know who you are, no one can ever touch you!"
477,2022-12-16 04:40:43+00:00,warikoo,"5. A beautiful life is to know how to live alone, but never have the need to.

6. Your fear of embarrassing yourself, is your biggest hurdle to growth.

7. No one is coming to save you. Your life is 100% your responsibility."
478,2022-12-16 04:40:43+00:00,warikoo,"1. You can change your past by changing the meaning of your memories.

It beats money, it beats talent, and it even beats luck!
A routine gives you all of it."
1022,2022-11-18 05:15:09+00:00,warikoo,"3. A routine needs a record

We are horrible at remembering things.
A routine needs an artifact that shows the past, present and future of it.
So that you spend your mind executing. Not remembering.

PS: This is my (google) calendar for 18th Nov next year. This routine is fixed! https://t.co/iOyhRsz3eL"
1023,2022-11-18 05:15:08+00:00,warikoo,"2. Routine needn't be repeated every day.

It can be every week, fortnight, month, qtr, year.
The key to a routine is not the frequency of repetition.
It is the act of repetition itself - leading to a habit. https://t.co/Xd2KQIsbIX"
1024,2022-11-18 05:15:06+00:00,warikoo,"3 things that will help you build your routine.

1. Your routine is specific to your current context.

For ex:
- Student's routine: sleep, food, school/college, self study and chill time.
- Working professional's routine: sleep, food, work, personal growth,  friends/family time."
1025,2022-11-18 05:15:05+00:00,warikoo,"So within a day, I have 3 routines.
1. A set routine comprising tasks.
2. A fluid routine comprising thinking and reflecting.
3. A routine to waste time.

Whether you are a student, a working professional, a homemaker, a freelancer, an entrepreneur - a routine is critical."
1026,2022-11-18 05:15:05+00:00,warikoo,"I end my day with an early meal, spending time with family, reading again and sleeping early.
That is ALSO a routine."
1027,2022-11-18 05:15:04+00:00,warikoo,"And then during the day, I have my distraction time scheduled.

Time that I have scheduled to 'waste time' (mostly on social media, mostly IG reels, haha).
That is ALSO a routine."
1028,2022-11-18 05:15:03+00:00,warikoo,"However when I sit down for my work, I have a very different routine.

That routine is to spend 1-2 hours everyday with NO AGENDA.
I read online, browse twitter, write on paper, reflect, look out the window, take breaks.
And that is ALSO a routine."
1029,2022-11-18 05:15:03+00:00,warikoo,"I have a morning routine, that I love.
I wake up, meditate, read, get the kids ready for school, play tennis, go to the gym, get ready, have a nice breakfast.
This is the most important part of my day.
That is my routine."
1030,2022-11-18 05:15:02+00:00,warikoo,"Which means, it can very well be a routine to 'do nothing'.

Let me explain, using my life as an example."
1031,2022-11-18 05:15:02+00:00,warikoo,"A routine is NOT moving from one task to another.
A routine is doing something repeatedly to the point it becomes natural to your life."
1032,2022-11-18 05:15:01+00:00,warikoo,These seemingly poor choices emerge because of a lack of understanding of what comprises a routine.
1033,2022-11-18 05:15:01+00:00,warikoo,"Choice 2 is to have a routine.
Stick to a calendar. Be organized.
But that leads to a boring life - we look like a robot, moving from one task to another!"
1034,2022-11-18 05:15:00+00:00,warikoo,"It seems that the world offers two really poor choices.

Choice 1 is to not have a routine.
Go with the flow.
But that ends up making us feel guilty of not managing our time effectively, procrastinating and ultimately not accomplishing the things we wanted to."
1035,2022-11-18 05:14:59+00:00,warikoo,"I was recently asked:
""You seem to be a person of routine. However, does a routine leave space for serendipity, luck or just casual thinking? When you are so set in your calendar, are you not a slave to the calendar itself?""

It's a brilliant question."

1418,2022-10-28 09:55:33+00:00,warikoo,"It‚Äôs my biggest weakness because I still fall in that trap.

Of wanting to help myself (they should feel I am a nice person), than helping them!

I have come to believe that most relationships falter because they never engage in Radical Candor."
1419,2022-10-28 09:55:32+00:00,warikoo,"Question 3: Will this feedback help them or help me?

Things that I said which, in hindsight helped only me and not them, was not feedback.
It was just my need to express myself.
The chart above helped me a lot.

I am most guilty of ruinous empathy."
1420,2022-10-28 09:55:32+00:00,warikoo,"Today, I make sure that I want them to win by whatever I say.

For ex:
""You do not even know why I am angry"" - is an unfair statement to make.
It makes it sound like you WANT the other person to forget, and use that as an excuse to remind them of their failure."
1421,2022-10-28 09:55:31+00:00,warikoo,"Question 2: Do I want the other person to truly win, or would I feel happy watching them lose?

I found myself in situations where I wanted the person to lose, so that I could pin point their mistakes, go one up on them and thus establish authority the next time I said something."
1422,2022-10-28 09:55:30+00:00,warikoo,"In hindsight - none of those remarks ever helped.

It just made them more defensive or exercise authority if they could.
Now, I ask a different question:
‚ÄúWhat is it that they know that I do not?‚Äù
That helps me see their side and approach it from that direction."
1423,2022-10-28 09:55:30+00:00,warikoo,"Question 1: Am I saying this because I feel anger or frustration?

I was guilty of this during my Groupon days.

Where a lot of what I said was simply anger/frustration because the US team had no idea what Asia needs or wants and they were simply imposing the US understanding."
1424,2022-10-28 09:55:29+00:00,warikoo,"Because now I had a way of managing my guilt of being harsh towards someone I cared for.

So today, before giving any feedback to any of my known ones, I ask these 3 questions:"
1425,2022-10-28 09:55:29+00:00,warikoo,"Top Right Quadrant:
It is ONLY when you challenge directly AND you care personally about the person you are giving feedback - that it is Radical Candor.

RC leads to instant change and needless to say, profound in nature!

The book hit me hard."
1426,2022-10-28 09:55:28+00:00,warikoo,"Top Left Quadrant:
If you do care about the person, but do not challenge directly, it is ruinous empathy.

It results in ignorance (people do not even know what to fix, if at all to fix anything) and thus no change.

This is what I was guilty of, for the longest time!"
1427,2022-10-28 09:55:27+00:00,warikoo,"Bottom Left Quadrant:
If you do not care about the person but you do not challenge directly either, instead sugar coat and pretend to be all nice and warm - that is manipulative insincerity.

Most toxic relationships lie here.
This results in mistrust and again, no change!"
1428,2022-10-28 09:55:27+00:00,warikoo,The end result of such an approach is instant defensiveness. With little change in the person we gave the feedback to.
1429,2022-10-28 09:55:26+00:00,warikoo,"Bottom Right Quadrant:
If you challenge the person directly, but you do not care for the person - then that is obnoxious aggression!

This is when you are harsh, you are rude, you are not being helpful.

We all know how that feels, because we have felt it."

1431,2022-10-28 09:55:24+00:00,warikoo,"One, do you care personally about the person you are giving feedback to - whether your friend, your relative, your colleague, whosoever!

Second, are you direct with that person or not? Or do you twist and turn or sugar coat your feedback?"
1432,2022-10-28 09:55:23+00:00,warikoo,"Until, I read the book 'Radical Candor'.

In this brilliant book by Kim Scott, Kim explains 4 types of feedback and how only one of them is effective.

DO NOT assume that it applies to your life too."
1556,2022-10-21 08:17:12+00:00,warikoo,"So here is something to consider

Instead of an instruction manual, wish for a mirror.

A mirror that can make you an observer of your own life.
So that you can see yourself, hear yourself, feel yourself.
And thus heal yourself, soothe yourself, grow yourself."
1557,2022-10-21 08:17:12+00:00,warikoo,"Growing up, it often felt like 'shit man, why does life not come with an instruction manual?""

And then it hit me - that instruction manual will be written by the very same people whose opinions I do not agree with, thus hoping for an instruction manual."
1558,2022-10-21 08:17:11+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
EVERYTHING happens ALL the time!

Life comprises 4 elements - Family, friends, health and work.
And you do not attend to them one after the other.
You attend to them all at once.

First work hard. Then enjoy your life.

You are not the only one confused.

Don't be harsh on yourself."

1562,2022-10-21 08:17:09+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
What you think of yourself, matters!

You then use the world to improve yourself, not to judge yourself!"
1563,2022-10-21 08:17:08+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 11:
What the world thinks of you, matters!

The world will define your worth.
It will tell you what you can or cannot do.
It will appraise you. Promote you. Fire you. Admit you. Offer you. Reject you.

You have to spend your time, pleasing the world."
1564,2022-10-21 08:17:08+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
You live life on your own pace

Don't feel it today?
That's ok.
Don't work.
Don't feel like doing anything?
That's ok.
Don't.

Time is NOT running out, unless you do not make that feeling your permanent reality."

Be productive. ALL the time!

In your 20s, every hour wasted, is an hour that you could have spent in making more money, find new friends, learn new things, find new opportunities, network, watch 60 more ads of warikoo!

Hustle, bro! Hustle!"
1566,2022-10-21 08:17:06+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
Life's purpose is to help yourself

You spread happiness, only when you are truly happy.
You listen, only when you can listen to your own thoughts.
You give, only when you know how to build within.

1567,2022-10-21 08:17:06+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 9:
Life's purpose is to help others

There was something magical being someone who was helping others.
You know, the SRK of their lives.
Making them happy, always giving, rarely taking, listening to them, solving their problems.

1568,2022-10-21 08:17:05+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
Being helpful &gt;&gt;&gt; being nice

That might mean, the other person may not appreciate you for your honesty in that moment.

But you center yourself on 'am I being helpful here?""

If yes, you do not care about being liked.
You care about them!"
1569,2022-10-21 08:17:05+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 8:
Be nice to people

Of course, be nice to people.
I realized the world was actually telling me was - be nice to people, even if that means telling a lie.
Tell lies to manipulate people to get to like you.
b/c no one wants to hear the truth.
So why bother?"
1570,2022-10-21 08:17:04+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
20s is the decade of habits

What we do this decade, sets us up for life.
Because this decade is when we experience work, relationships and money for the first time.
And our early experience with them, decide our eventual experience with them."
1571,2022-10-21 08:17:03+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 7:
20s is to chill. Don't take life so seriously!

The world had a split personality.
No, seriously!

One day they would ask me to settle down.
The same evening, they would tell me to eat shit and party, because YOLO!

As if we are meant to live two lives this decade!"
1572,2022-10-21 08:17:03+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
Express yourself in a way that HELPS you

Whenever I listened to my emotions and respected them, I felt stronger.
Even if I had tears in that moment.

I converted my emotions into my strength, not my weakness.
By allowing them entry."
1573,2022-10-21 08:17:02+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 6:
As a guy, don't cry!

I was told my role is to be strong, to not exhibit weakness, to sit with my legs wide open, to not share my problems and not to seek help either!
To be someone they called alpha.

If I cried watching Titanic, I was to be thrown out of the club."
1574,2022-10-21 08:17:02+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
When you find the right person, you find the one to SHARE your happiness with.

If you are not happy within, and you expect the other person to make you happy, game over my friend.
b/c everytime you are sad, you expect them to solve for it! :("

When you find the right person, you will find happiness.

Being in love was imagined to be a happiness grant.
Once you found the love of your life, you will find in them an eternal source of happiness.

All you will have to do is to say 'I love you' infinitely :))"
1576,2022-10-21 08:17:00+00:00,warikoo,"Truth I realized:
You are not rewarded for being fast.
You are rewarded for being accurate.

Accuracy &gt;&gt; Speed &gt;&gt; Perfection"
1577,2022-10-21 08:17:00+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 4:
Speed = capability

If you are capable, intelligent, you should be able to do your work faster than others.
Recall those kids that finished the 4hr exam in 2hrs - yeah that shit!

So I did the same at work.
Turned in my work faster.
With errors!
b/c speed &gt;&gt; perfection!"
1578,2022-10-21 08:16:59+00:00,warikoo,"The truth I realized:
Don't try to be smart.
Try to be understood.

If people understand you, that is being smart!
If people find you relatable, that is being smart.
If people are not intimated by you, instead find you approachable, that is being smart."
1579,2022-10-21 08:16:59+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 3:
You have to come across as smart.

That became life's goal.
Read books that made you look smart.
Use words that made you sound smart.
Hang out with people who made you smart.

You were judged if you said or did things that it didn't consider smart!"
1580,2022-10-21 08:16:58+00:00,warikoo,"The truth I realized:
Money doesn't buy you things.
Money buys you time.
Time to do what YOU want to do.

At your own pace.
On your own terms."
1581,2022-10-21 08:16:57+00:00,warikoo,"Lie 2:
Money buys you success.

I saw everyone run after money.

1712,2022-10-14 10:09:14+00:00,warikoo,"4. Be authentic

A strong pillar of my life is being authentic.
I am who I am - whether you see me on YT, TW, in the mall or at a restaurant.
You will find the same person.

On TW that meant, sharing things that I care about as against things that people would want to know."

1714,2022-10-14 10:09:13+00:00,warikoo,"3. Be helpful

Help never goes into an abyss.
It might only when we expect something out of the help we extend.

I wanted to be helpful to those in their 20s.
Which meant that my content will, by design, not appeal to everyone.
And that was a choice I was willing to make."
1715,2022-10-14 10:09:12+00:00,warikoo,"But that required me to also boldly share my failures, since they were such a huge part of my life.

Whenever I did, people didn't someone who had won every single time.
They found themselves, who might be failing, but could rise up again.

1716,2022-10-14 10:09:11+00:00,warikoo,"2. Be vulnerable

I am lucky I started creating content at the age of 40, by which time I had changed careers, started companies, made a LOT of mistakes and learnt a lot reflecting upon them.

Sharing my life's learning became the easy (and perpetual) content source."
1717,2022-10-14 10:09:11+00:00,warikoo,"Until Mar 2020, and I decided to double-down on content.

Apr 24, 2020 I wrote my 2nd thread.
And have been writing a thread every Friday since then.

Its not the everyday tweeting that defines consistency.
Its the rhythm you establish in your community's mind, that defines it."
1718,2022-10-14 10:09:10+00:00,warikoo,"1. Be consistent

I joined TW in 2009.
Consumed it (as a confused soul) until 2017
Then I began to sporadically contribute.
In 2019, on my 39th birthday I shared a thread that was received well.
https://t.co/8kxmfZ3oHA
I treated it one-off and went back to my sporadic tweeting."

What warrants this thread then, is the fact that despite knowing these facts we tend to repeat the same mistakes.
Over and over again.

Hence, a reminder."
2155,2022-09-23 06:14:38+00:00,warikoo,"20. Being calm is a skill

We are born to react.
Training ourselves not to, take time, practice and intent."
2156,2022-09-23 06:14:37+00:00,warikoo,"19. If you do not care about people's validation, you will get it automatically.

You will make your best friends, when not looking for one.
You will find your soul mate, when not searching for one."
2157,2022-09-23 06:14:37+00:00,warikoo,"18. If people like you, life becomes easier.

Be kind!"
2158,2022-09-23 06:14:36+00:00,warikoo,"17. Crave for feedback, not admiration.

Admiration makes you believe you are right.
Feedback shows you how you could be right."
2159,2022-09-23 06:14:35+00:00,warikoo,"16. That thing that you were scolded for as a kid could be the thing you are praised for as an adult.

Do not take the world's assessment of you as a kid, as the truth!"
2160,2022-09-23 06:14:35+00:00,warikoo,"15. We were all born with different capabilities.
But there is no limit on how much we can grow from what we had."
2161,2022-09-23 06:14:34+00:00,warikoo,"14. The more you give, the more you‚Äôll get.

But don't give with the expectation of getting.
That is not giving.
That is a transaction!"
2162,2022-09-23 06:14:34+00:00,warikoo,"13. Pro is the amateur that showed up everyday.

99% of success is just showing up."

Do not take permanent decisions based on temporary emotions."
2164,2022-09-23 06:14:33+00:00,warikoo,12. Love and time heals everything.
2165,2022-09-23 06:14:32+00:00,warikoo,"11. Buying things is expensive.

And it is not money that I am talking about.
It is the need to show off.
The addiction.
The indulgence.
The treadmill which you cannot get off, the one that tells that you have to keep buying things to be happy."
2166,2022-09-23 06:14:31+00:00,warikoo,"10. Even the work you thoroughly enjoy, will suck some days!

Your job is not to find work that is awesome everyday.
Your job is to find work that you find awesome most days.
Your work should not suck!
If it does, reflect on the reason you are still in it."
2167,2022-09-23 06:14:31+00:00,warikoo,"9. Relationships should make you a better person.

And yet we continue to suffer in relationships.
Even the ones we chose for ourselves."
2168,2022-09-23 06:14:30+00:00,warikoo,"8. Excuses do not make us grow.

We promise to do something, but we could not.
So we come up with an excuse.
As if an excuse is equal to getting the work done.
They do not.
They just make us feel we are not in control."
2169,2022-09-23 06:14:30+00:00,warikoo,"7. Failure is NOT the stepping stone to success.

Everyone fails
But not everyone succeeds.
Between failure and success lies reflection.

A failure not reflected upon, is a failure wasted!"
2170,2022-09-23 06:14:29+00:00,warikoo,"6. Nobody is responsible for our life.

We bear the consequences of our actions.
We are responsible for our life.

Your worst enemy is the one who convinces you that your life sucks because of someone or something else!
That enemy could be you!"
2171,2022-09-23 06:14:28+00:00,warikoo,"5. You and your friends will change.

You will become different people.
You may not relate to them anymore.

It is ok to move on."
2172,2022-09-23 06:14:28+00:00,warikoo,"4. Our parents are not always right.

They are humans first, became parents later.
And no training taught them how to do the job well.
They learnt along the way.
Made a lot of mistakes.
And still continue to.

Forgive them."
2173,2022-09-23 06:14:27+00:00,warikoo,"3. We are not the only ones confused.

We are not the only ones struggling.
We are not the only one not sure of ourselves.

Everyone carries a load.
We just see ours."
2174,2022-09-23 06:14:27+00:00,warikoo,"2. People do not expect us to be rich. They expect us to be kind.

Yet we spend far more energy trying to come across as rich, as against kind!"
2175,2022-09-23 06:14:26+00:00,warikoo,"1. We are not the center of everyone's life

We are the center of our life. Just as people as the center of theirs.
Our lives intersect. They do not rule over each other!"

'this is the first book we have read/finished'

Nothing makes me happier!"
2491,2022-09-02 05:30:46+00:00,warikoo,"Today:
1. The book has sold over 200,000+ copies, making it one of the best selling books of the year.
2. It is already in 8 languages (English, 6 regional languages, Portuguese)
3. Acc to my estimate, 350,000+ additional pirated copies have been sold."
2492,2022-09-02 05:30:45+00:00,warikoo,"Did all of this work?

The book launched #1 on all possible spots. 
The 5,000 signed copies got sold out in less than 3hrs! https://t.co/UmrMGBH73F"

FOMO set in.
They wanted the acknowledgement too.
So they too shared.
I acknowledged them too.
Others saw the acknowledgement.

The cycle wonderfully continued."
2495,2022-09-02 05:30:39+00:00,warikoo,"3. Engage with the audience talking about the book

This became the big game changer. Since folks were reading the book and tweeting/instagramming it, my job became to acknowledge them.

That was a big deal for them. They loved the acknowledge."
2496,2022-09-02 05:30:39+00:00,warikoo,"While signing, I also added some surprises. Because I knew they would come back to create a ripple effect.

And they did :) https://t.co/lU17K6XsUK"
2497,2022-09-02 05:30:36+00:00,warikoo,"I signed 5,000 copies for them, so that they not only got the first copy of the book, but also something for keeps.

Took 2+ days to sign these copies. But I am so glad I did :) https://t.co/tTO4lviuxE"
2498,2022-09-02 05:30:28+00:00,warikoo,"2. Capitalize on the current following that the personal brand had built.

The book was pre-launched on Dec 9th 2021 and I knew the early buyers would be the followers of Ankur Warikoo."
2499,2022-09-02 05:30:27+00:00,warikoo,"The book was also written in such a way that it made it very share-friendly on social media.

People clicked photos, proudly so!

People created their own stories around the 'story-less book'

2500,2022-09-02 05:30:26+00:00,warikoo,"So we made the book look really cute. 

I think its a stunning cover (thanks @Chikisarkar), its small in size and it really looks good in photos!

2501,2022-09-02 05:30:25+00:00,warikoo,"To make sure the book launched well and continued to sell well, we decided on 3 things:

1. Make the book instagrammable

The audience doesn't read, is surely spending time on Instagram.

If they did end up reading the book, I wanted them to feel a sense of pride.
And show off!"
2502,2022-09-02 05:30:24+00:00,warikoo,"It was a gamble, which thankfully paid off.

Within a few months, the book was seen selling for Rs. 50-150 on the streets of India.

How do we know they were pirated?
Because all of them were paperback, while we only had a hardcover in circulation! https://t.co/BHIaJbxFi9"
2503,2022-09-02 05:30:22+00:00,warikoo,"Because I knew that if the book does well, it will be pirated.
And the high cost of the book would make the cheaper pirated version look more attractive.

Plus pirated versions tend to crowd the roadside bookstalls and traffic lights.
The right visibility!"
2504,2022-09-02 05:30:22+00:00,warikoo,"Problem #3: Books are considered expensive, as compared to cheap/free entertainment.

10 years of running Groupon/nearbuy has taught me a lot about pricing.
I played a game here.

We decided to release ONLY a hardcover and priced it Rs. 399.
For India, that is an expensive book!"
2505,2022-09-02 05:30:21+00:00,warikoo,"I made the book super easy to read.

Spaced out words. Lots of empty space. 
While the book is 293 pages, it is technically no more than 150 pages.

So it was easy to read it.
And easy to finish as well, should one want to. https://t.co/aYfsG2FdNY"
2506,2022-09-02 05:30:15+00:00,warikoo,"Problem #2: It requires commitment to finish a book

Since the book had no story, you technically didn't have to finish it!
Yay!

You could read a page and leave it. Or read 10 and leave it. 
And it would still (hopefully) help you in some manner!

I did one more thing..."
2507,2022-09-02 05:30:15+00:00,warikoo,"We picked my best performing content for the past 3 years, created categories, bucketed the content pieces into those categories and went through 4+ rounds of intense editing, to make this 'story-less' book.

Huge shoutout to @nishthagehija26 for actually writing the book!"
2508,2022-09-02 05:30:14+00:00,warikoo,"For this, the content had to be disconnected by design. 
I knew this would be extremely disconcerting to all genuine book readers.
But I wasn't writing for them.
Or to win any literary award.

My audience, I knew, needed a book that needed little attention to consume it!"
2509,2022-09-02 05:30:13+00:00,warikoo,"Problem #1: It requires attention to follow a story.

I decided to not have a story!
The book would have no start and no finish. 
The inspiration for this was a game I used to play in school - book cricket.
Open a random page and the page number would be your score. https://t.co/P95qLGuKnx"
2510,2022-09-02 05:30:12+00:00,warikoo,"My book, if it had to appeal to this segment, had to solve for these 3 core problems.

Here is how I did it..."
2511,2022-09-02 05:30:11+00:00,warikoo,"I came to 3 reasons
1. It requires attention to follow a story.
2. It requires commitment to finish a book.
3. It is thus considered expensive, as compared to cheap/free entertainment."
2512,2022-09-02 05:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"But that wasn't easy. Because, by definition, they do not like reading or have never read.

So I asked myself this question, 'what are the top reasons they do not read?'"
2513,2022-09-02 05:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"And it broke my heart to see that there were so many people, not just the younger generation, that rarely read books or had never read one.

I wanted to write for them."
2514,2022-09-02 05:30:09+00:00,warikoo,"I have benefitted immensely from books, all my life.

It is crazy that for the prize of a large pizza, I get to learn from the experience and caliber of someone else's life.

In context of the book, the question was, 'Who am I writing this book for?'"
2516,2022-09-02 05:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"She gladly agreed and in 2020 I signed my first ever book deal. 

Since this was peak-COVID, I asked for time to get the book together. I wanted people to be in the right frame to even want a new book in their hands. 

As I sat down to write the book, I went back to..."

2519,2022-09-02 05:30:05+00:00,warikoo,"Sorry what?!?

While I had writing a blog for 10+ years at that point and I genuinely loved writing, I had never seen myself as an author.

So I frankly felt that she was being really nice. I thanked her and promised to stay in touch."

To survive, you have to spend a certain amount. You can't (and shouldn't) go lower than that. There is a cap.
But your income has no cap!"

Use deals/discount platforms whenever you can

There is no shame in using coupon codes, or buying vouchers to save money.
It is your money!
Be smart about it.

Till date I get emails from users who saved thousands in a year using nearbuy."

Create a budget

Boring...! But it works.
Please prepare a budget for your expenses - your needs, your wants, your investments.

For ex:
50:30:20 is a good rule to start with.
No more than 50% of your income towards your needs (EMIs, food, utilities etc)..."

Buy life insurance early on

When young, the premium amount is much lower, because you are healthier with lesser chances of death.
And you lock that premium for the entire period.

If you buy insurance at 25, until 65..."
2742,2022-08-19 05:51:02+00:00,warikoo,"Hack #10
Pay off your loans faster

Just because you have a 25-yr home loan, doesn't mean you take 25-yrs to pay it off.

For ex:
1 extra EMI/year (so 13 instead of 12) + increase EMI by 10% every year, reduces a 25-yr loan to just 10yrs!
You save 60% on your interest amount!"

Use incognito while buying online

I have no way to prove it, but I have seen prices go up if I keep searching for items online, be it flight tickets or even products on Amazon.

Use incognito to make purchases online."
2744,2022-08-19 05:51:01+00:00,warikoo,"Hack #8
Buy bigger sizes

Bigger sizes tend to be cheaper, on a per unit basis.

For ex: Water 500ml is way more expensive than water 20L can.
(On that note, please don't buy water!)

If you have the space to store, go for it."

Use credit cards, ONLY if you have 100% of the money

1. You get an interest free loan (30-45 days). If your credit card spend is a lot, park that money in a debt fund and earn some free money (for doing nothing!)
2. You build your credit rating
3. You earn reward points"
2749,2022-08-19 05:50:58+00:00,warikoo,"Hack #3
Use UPI instead of credit cards

1. Credit cards give the illusion of money, which you may not have. So we tend to overspend.
2. UPI is free (a lot of places still charge a surcharge on credit cards)
3. UPI is money you have. So you tend to spend accordingly."

Try a non-spending day

We don't realize how we end up spending everyday, even when we do not need to.

Try ""fasting"" with your money.
Once a week/fortnight/month - do not spend on anything.

This will require preparing in advance, which is why this hack works so well."

Automate your savings

If we have money in the bank, we tend to spend it.
So move money out of your bank account.

For ex:
- Sign up for as much EPF deduction as you can, so it never even reaches you, but continues to compound.
- SIPs (and don't stop them!)"

2894,2022-08-05 04:51:13+00:00,warikoo,"Here is a list of all the 100+ threads I have written
https://t.co/dD1iP9tmMK"
2895,2022-08-05 04:51:12+00:00,warikoo,"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.

- Buddha"
2896,2022-08-05 04:51:11+00:00,warikoo,"There is often irreparable and I would argue unnecessary damage that anger causes.

Save yourself the damage.
Save yourself the anger."
2897,2022-08-05 04:51:10+00:00,warikoo,"The trick is: has you mind done this enough times to know what to do this time around? 

Your brain is a muscle.
Just as you are not surprised anymore at how rapidly your brain brings back memories from the past to help you in the present, you won't be surprised at this either."
2898,2022-08-05 04:51:10+00:00,warikoo,"A lot of you may be left thinking 
""In that moment of rage, it is impossible to go through all of these steps. In that moment, you simply want to shout.""

In written form, this looks like a long drawn sequence of affairs. 
In reality, all of this happens in milliseconds."
2899,2022-08-05 04:51:09+00:00,warikoo,"The second you realize what that need is, anger goes, ‚Äúoh cool - you remember? Awesome. I am done. I will now go back to chilling. Have a good day, you lovely.‚Äù

And anger will be gone!"
2900,2022-08-05 04:51:09+00:00,warikoo,"To prepare you for it. 
To make you realize that this need is unfulfilled. 
And that the person opposite or this situation you are in, is provoking it. 
Do something about it. 
Anger is shouting at you, ‚ÄúDO YOU REMEMBER THAT NEED OF YOURS?‚Äù"
2901,2022-08-05 04:51:08+00:00,warikoo,"How does identifying this unfulfilled need help my anger? 

Go back to where we started. 
Every emotion is there to serve a purpose. 
Anger‚Äôs purpose is to warn you. 
And get you to defend yourself. 
You realize that your unfulfilled need is surfacing. 
And anger is activated."
2902,2022-08-05 04:51:07+00:00,warikoo,"Step 3: 
Understand your anger

All anger stems from an unfulfilled need. 
Uncover that need. 

How?
That is a personal journal. 
For some it could be through writing a journal. 
For some through a conversation with themselves. 
For some through therapy."
2903,2022-08-05 04:51:07+00:00,warikoo,"This step takes time and practice.

There will be enough moments during the day where you will begin to feel the anger emerge. 

Don't get angry.
Begin to observe it.

Start with the small incidents, where it will be relatively easier to let go of the anger."
2904,2022-08-05 04:51:06+00:00,warikoo,"Meditation helps here immensely.
Meditation is like sitting by the road side watching cars go by.

Anger is one such car. 
You see it, you see what‚Äôs inside, you notice its color, its speed, its make. 
But you don‚Äôt stop it, or get onto it. 
You simply watch it go past you."
2905,2022-08-05 04:51:06+00:00,warikoo,"Step 2:
Count till ten and take deep breaths.

It sounds funny, but it works. 
Calm down. 

DO NOT react in that moment. 

You have, already won half the battle by recognizing you are about to get angry. 
You are already an observer. 

Now let that anger go past you."
2906,2022-08-05 04:51:05+00:00,warikoo,"Step 1:
Recognize that you are about to get angry.

Anger is a strong emotion. 
We all know how it feels. 
We can all sense it even before it comes.
We just let it flow, because in that moment, we WANT to get angry.
But remember, we don't HAVE to get angry."
2907,2022-08-05 04:51:04+00:00,warikoo,"How do you eliminate it? 
You can't.

We can't eliminate anger.
We can only manage it.

Here is an approach that might help."
2908,2022-08-05 04:51:04+00:00,warikoo,"You get angry because someone picks up the phone while in a conversation.
Not because of the phone.
Instead because of your unmet need to be heard, to be respected.
You do not want to be just some random person!"
2909,2022-08-05 04:51:03+00:00,warikoo,"You get angry whenever someone tries to control you.
Not because of the control.
Instead because you were controlled as a kid, and you hated it. 
Your need to be free, is what makes you angry!"
2910,2022-08-05 04:51:03+00:00,warikoo,"THAT feeling made you angry. 
Not the lying. 
But the feeling of feeling stupid."
2911,2022-08-05 04:51:02+00:00,warikoo,"On the surface it may look like that someone lied and it made you angry. 

However, when we scratch the surface, we may find that we felt stupid to have believed the lie. 

And feeling stupid is something you do not want to ever feel!"
2912,2022-08-05 04:51:01+00:00,warikoo,"All our emotions serve a purpose.

Anger, for instance, surfaces when a very important need of ours is not met."

One-off or lumpsum investing might not work, basis when you invested. 
Regular (ideally monthly investing, otherwise called SIP) ensures you average out the highs/lows of the market"
2983,2022-07-29 04:37:23+00:00,warikoo,"What are the risks involved in stock market investing?

1. Short term risk
If you wish to invest for less than 5 years, this may not be the right approach, because the market might give you poor returns

For ex: Rs. 100 invested in Sensex in 2017, would still be Rs. 100 in 2020!"
2984,2022-07-29 04:37:23+00:00,warikoo,"What this approach ensures?
1. Relying on experts (Mutual Fund managers) 
2. Done in the most economical manner (Index Mutual Funds are mostly low cost)
3. Manages your risk, while delivering returns"
2985,2022-07-29 04:37:22+00:00,warikoo,"So depending on your risk profile, here is what I would suggest as the mix of your stock market investing. https://t.co/FVVdSA0LS0"
2986,2022-07-29 04:37:20+00:00,warikoo,"Rs. 100 invested in 2013 would be today:

Large Cap: Rs. 292
Mid Cap: Rs. 545
Small Cap: Rs. 888 https://t.co/76oM9O3eG6"
2987,2022-07-29 04:37:19+00:00,warikoo,"Notice how when the market rises and falls, the large cap moves the least and small cap moves the most.

However, over a long period of time, small cap delivers more returns, while large cap delivers relatively lower."
2988,2022-07-29 04:37:18+00:00,warikoo,"Good news is that there are Mutual Funds for each of these segments

Ex: SBI Mutual Funds for all 3 (not promoted post) https://t.co/9Wfv4A3CWP"
2989,2022-07-29 04:37:16+00:00,warikoo,"Large cap companies are far more stable, thus tend to not go up/down a lot.
However, because they are big, they tend to not grow as fast (in % terms). 

Midcap companies: relatively more up and down, relatively better returns

Smallcap: significant ups/downs; better returns"
2990,2022-07-29 04:37:16+00:00,warikoo,"The stock market is divided broadly into 3 types of companies, based on their size.

Large Cap companies: Those valued at upwards of Rs. 20,000 Crores
Mid Cap companies: Between Rs. 5,000-20,000 Crores
Small Cap companies: Less than Rs. 5,000 Crores

How does this matter?"
2991,2022-07-29 04:37:15+00:00,warikoo,"Irrespective of your risk profile, a good way to enter the stock market is buying a portfolio of stocks (usually called Mutual Funds)

Buying individual stocks requires a lot of research, analysis, time, which a beginner may not have."
2992,2022-07-29 04:37:14+00:00,warikoo,"These small percentages changes make a huge difference

1L invested for 20 years at 12% = ~8L
1L invested for 20 years at 15% = ~16L
1L invested for 20 years at 18% = ~32L

But the one getting 18% might see their value go down massively, before it rises up again."
2993,2022-07-29 04:37:14+00:00,warikoo,"2. Medium risk (ok with medium ups/downs, to get slightly better returns - around 13-15% annually)

3. High risk (ok with ups/downs as long as I get the best returns - around 15-18% annually)"
2994,2022-07-29 04:37:13+00:00,warikoo,"How do you change the way you invest according to your risk profile?

To make it simple, pick one of the 3 risk profiles
1. Low risk (I do not want a lot of ups and down, and for that I am ok with lower returns - around 11-12% annually, as against 5% FD)"
2995,2022-07-29 04:37:13+00:00,warikoo,"Mid-way summary:
1. Stock markets WILL go up and down
2. But over long term deliver much better results than other investments
3. So if you do not like the risk, please don't reduce the amount you invest in stock market. Instead, change the way you invest in the stock market."
2996,2022-07-29 04:37:12+00:00,warikoo,"If you are risk averse, you need to invest in such a way that the ups and downs of the stock market are minimal (called low volatility or low beta).

Not reduce the amount invested in the stock market."
2997,2022-07-29 04:37:11+00:00,warikoo,"3. Do not reduce the money you invest in the stock market. Instead, change the way you invest in the stock market.

This is important.
Most people who are not comfortable with risk, reduce the amount they invest in the stock market. 
That is the wrong approach."
2998,2022-07-29 04:37:11+00:00,warikoo,"If you are aged X, then (100-X)% of the monthly amount you invest, should be invested in the stock market (for the long term)

So if you are 25, you should invest 75% of your monthly investable amount in the stock market."
2999,2022-07-29 04:37:10+00:00,warikoo,"2. Ok, so the market goes up and down - does this mean you do not invest? NO!

It means you need to have a long-term horizon to investing.

A good approach for this is called the 100-X rule"
3000,2022-07-29 04:37:09+00:00,warikoo,"However, the same Sensex over 10 years would show a different story.

This says if I invested Rs. 100 in the Sensex in July 2012, I would have Rs. 331 today!
Same money in

Gold: Rs. 187

Not too bad, huh? https://t.co/pnycgLuW8f"
3001,2022-07-29 04:37:08+00:00,warikoo,"What does this graph mean?

That if you invested Rs. 100 in the Sensex on 2nd Feb, it would become Rs. 89 on 7th Mar, jump back to Rs. 102 by 4th April and today would be Rs. 96!

That is a LOT of movement in just 6 months.

3221,2022-07-09 08:58:39+00:00,warikoo,"Every Friday (this time Saturday!) I write a thread on personal growth, failures, startups, organization building and more.
You can follow me on @warikoo to get them on your feed."
3222,2022-07-09 08:58:38+00:00,warikoo,"21.  Your role is not to be the apple of the founder's or the CEO's or the manager's eyes. 
When you do what is stated above diligently, it eventually happens without you forcibly trying to!"
3223,2022-07-09 08:58:38+00:00,warikoo,"19.  You do not become indispensable by wanting to be indispensable. You become indispensable by showing up and doing the hard things even when no one is watching.

20.  When you've made a mistake, own it up. And do not repeat it. Making a mistake twice is a mistake wasted."
3224,2022-07-09 08:58:37+00:00,warikoo,"17.  Nothing, absolutely nothing is a reason to be disrespectful to anyone. Be respectful. Always. Even while resolving conflicts.

18.  Let go of credit when you need it the most. It will fortify you as a human being."
3225,2022-07-09 08:58:37+00:00,warikoo,"13.  Never be overheard complaining. Not even to yourself. 

14.  Be on time. If you cannot be early.

15.  Start with trust. You will gain more of it when you give it away.

16.  Do not assume. Ask."
3226,2022-07-09 08:58:36+00:00,warikoo,"11.  When you commit to doing something, make sure people do not have to follow-up with you. 

12.  Make relationships at work. Be genuinely interested in people."
3227,2022-07-09 08:58:35+00:00,warikoo,"8.  Take notes. Do not try to remember everything (infact anything!). 
Carry a notebook. 

9.  Do not be driven only by money. 
Focus on learning velocity. Money will come as a by-product.

10.  Choose to deliver only A-quality work. Your work is your signature."
3228,2022-07-09 08:58:35+00:00,warikoo,"5.  Talk to people from different departments. 
Ask yourself ""what do they know that I do not?""

6.  Get to know your colleagues beyond work. What drives them; what doesn't.

7.  Your role is first to learn and then to create impact. Not the other way around."
3229,2022-07-09 08:58:34+00:00,warikoo,"1.  Observe everything and everyone at your workplace. 
It educates you about the culture.

2.  Ask for specific feedback. Don't wait for it.

3.  Listen. More than you talk.

4.  Do not indulge in corporate politics. Stay away from places where it is encouraged."

3251,2022-07-07 15:04:41+00:00,warikoo,"@jaycee77 @VauldOfficial If you watch the video I have mentioned about the risks. 

That particular statement was around no variability in the yield (fixed returns). The mistake I made and admit to, is to ignore bankrun risk (withdrawals &gt; deposits). Such events as rare as they are, are still possible."
3252,2022-07-07 14:38:51+00:00,warikoo,"@jaycee77 @VauldOfficial The diligence was on vauld and not crypto. I have been an investor in crypto since 2017. 

Vauld checked my dd list
1. Experienced founder 
2. Backed assets (not enough clearly)
3. Imminent investors (who would have done their own dd)
4. My personal experience with the product"

Talk is cheap. 

Will I be affected personally if my words do not hold in the future? If yes, I would do it because I am responsible for the consequences of my actions."

3255,2022-07-07 13:13:53+00:00,warikoo,"@jaycee77 @VauldOfficial 1. The video is marked promoted 
2. I didn‚Äôt suggest because I invested my money it is right. I simply responded to a tweet that asked if I was impacted because of this. 
3. I have always maintained to invest no more than 5-10% in crypto.

Appreciate your questions, Jitendra"
3256,2022-07-07 12:27:55+00:00,warikoo,"@kamath_sandeep Yes. Started using it as a user, liked the product, then spent a month asking my questions from the founder and understanding how it works, and then decided to endorse them while continuing to invest my own money through them."

""The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.""
- Robertson Davies"
3365,2022-06-24 06:06:00+00:00,warikoo,"17. Blind Spot Bias
We don't think we have biases. But we see it in others.

Ex: ""I am not biased."""
3366,2022-06-24 06:05:59+00:00,warikoo,"16. In-group favoritism
We tend to agree more with folks in our group, than outside of our group.

Ex: ""Ankur is from Delhi, so I like him more than someone from Mumbai. Because I am from Delhi."""
3367,2022-06-24 06:05:59+00:00,warikoo,"15. Fundamental Attribution Error
We judge others on their personality or behavior, but we judge ourselves on the situation.

Ex: ""Ankur is poor. He must be lazy. I am poor because I did not get the right opportunities."""
3368,2022-06-24 06:05:58+00:00,warikoo,"14. Self-serving Bias
Our failures are situational, but our success is our hard work.

Ex: ""I passed that exam because I worked hard. I failed that interview because I got late."""
3369,2022-06-24 06:05:57+00:00,warikoo,"13. Curse of knowledge
Once we know something, we think that everyone else also knows it.

Ex: ""I shouldn't share this content. Its so basic. Everyone knows this."""
3370,2022-06-24 06:05:56+00:00,warikoo,"11. Gambler's Fallacy
We think future possibilities are affected by past events, even though they are independent.

Ex: ""Ankur is tossing the coin and heads has come up 9 times. Now it will be tails for sure."""
3371,2022-06-24 06:05:56+00:00,warikoo,"10. Sunk Cost Fallacy
We invest more in things that have cost us something, even if we face negative outcomes.

Ex: ""Ankur is still holding on to that stock investment with a -80% return. Infact he is investing more."""
3372,2022-06-24 06:05:55+00:00,warikoo,"9. Declinism
We tend to think that the past was better than the future will be.

Ex: ""In our times, we had a lot more patience."""
3373,2022-06-24 06:05:54+00:00,warikoo,"8. Framing Effect
We draw different conclusions from the same information, basis how the information is presented.

Ex: ""Only 5% Indians invest in the stock market. There must be something wrong in it.
Only 5% Indians invest in the stock market. Imagine the potential."""
3374,2022-06-24 06:05:54+00:00,warikoo,"7. Pessimism Bias
We tend to overestimate the probability of bad outcomes.

Ex: ""I am sure I won't find a cab in time for the interview."""
3375,2022-06-24 06:05:53+00:00,warikoo,"6. Ikea Effect
We place higher value on things that we have worked on ourselves.

Ex: ""Isn't the cake awesome? I made it."""
3376,2022-06-24 06:05:53+00:00,warikoo,"5. Zeigarnik Effect
We remember incomplete tasks more than completed tasks.

Ex: ""Ankur continues to feel guilty that he hasn't finished those 2 tasks, ignoring that he has finished 10 others."""
3377,2022-06-24 06:05:52+00:00,warikoo,"4. Survivorship Bias
We assume that the stories of those who survived, is the entire story. Because the ""dead"" are not there to share any story.

Ex: ""So many unicorns being made every day. Entrepreneurship must be really awesome."""
3378,2022-06-24 06:05:51+00:00,warikoo,"3. Status Quo bias
We prefer things to stay the same; change is mostly considered a negative thing.

Ex: ""Ankur continues to be friends with toxic people, because they are childhood friends."""
3379,2022-06-24 06:05:51+00:00,warikoo,"2. Third-person effect

We believe that others are more influenced by social media and mass media, than we are. 

Ex: ""You are clearly watching a lot of news"""
3380,2022-06-24 06:05:50+00:00,warikoo,"1. Spotlight effect
We overestimate how much attention people pay to our words and appearance.

1. As a startup, we were looking for those who could go beyond the stipulated mandates.

2. We wanted to see if we can get the most recommended students to also apply."

We sense nervousness."
3475,2022-06-17 07:13:57+00:00,warikoo,"2. Will naming someone else better than us, reduce our chances of getting an interview shortlist?

We sensed fear."
3476,2022-06-17 07:13:56+00:00,warikoo,"Students had questions. 
A LOT of questions. 

1. ‚Äúwhat does color mean?‚Äù
Do you mean actual color? 
Or ‚Äúadd color‚Äù figuratively?
This led to the most joyful submissions

Comic books
Highlights

We sensed liberation."

AND 
‚ÄúAdd color to it‚Äù 

2. On the resume, name someone else from the batch who you think is better than you, for the role you are applying for.

Instead, undertake this decade's journey to find out which ones work for you and which don't."

We are surrounded by the most people we have even been surrounded by.
And yet constantly feel alone.

And at 42 I realize that a large part of the reason are these self-imposed beliefs we live our 20s by.
A set of rules  that we feel are fixed."
3611,2022-06-10 06:11:37+00:00,warikoo,"""I should not lose my friends""

You will dread losing your friends.
You will dread being alone.
You will dread growing apart.
Even though you are not happy in those relationships anymore.

Truth is - you will outgrow your friends. It is ok to move on."
3612,2022-06-10 06:11:37+00:00,warikoo,"""I will become an adult one day""

We think there is a an age when we suddenly grow up.
And growing up means we have sorted everything out.
We know the answers to all questions.
We are in control.

Truth is - we will never have all the answers. That is life."
3613,2022-06-10 06:11:36+00:00,warikoo,"""I am going to change the world""

We all dream of something big, meaningful, purposeful for our life.
We pick that desire; make it into a goal. 
Only to be disappointed if it doesn't happen.

Truth is - the ones who change the world never set out to do so. They realized they had."
3614,2022-06-10 06:11:35+00:00,warikoo,"""I can always do that later""

We postpone things.
Calling that friend.
Quitting that toxic job.
Going to the gym.
Saying ""I love you"".
Following our heart.

We are in a hurry to win.
So we postpone living.

Truth is - life isn't a goal.
It is a day passing by, every single day."
3615,2022-06-10 06:11:35+00:00,warikoo,"""Health and sleep can wait""

We pull out all-nighters. Sleep odd hours.
Eat junk. Eat odd hours. Abuse our body.
Because we believe there is a tomorrow when we will fix everything.

Truth is - how we treat our body in our 20s is how our body treats us for the rest of our life."
3616,2022-06-10 06:11:34+00:00,warikoo,"""I have to be liked by all""

In our 20s, we crave for validation and acknowledgement.
We attempt to please all, because we believe that to be a way to win!

Truth is - we can never be liked by all.
Be yourself. The right people will come to you and stay."
3617,2022-06-10 06:11:34+00:00,warikoo,"""I need to find my passion""
 
We obsess over our passion.
Expecting it to be lying in some corner, waiting to be discovered.
And when we do, our life will never be the same again.

Truth is - we do not find our passion. 
We grow our passion.
And that's a long journey. For all."
3618,2022-06-10 06:11:33+00:00,warikoo,"""This year is make or break for me""

I remember feeling this way for every year in my 20s.
This year is when I had to do it.
Else I won't be able to.
The story repeated every year!

Truth is - in a 80yr life no one year has the power to impact your life, unless you allow it to."
3619,2022-06-10 06:11:32+00:00,warikoo,"""I want people to know I am successful.""

You want that phone, that car, that salary, that brand - to look good.
You want people to talk highly of you.

Truth is - people's opinion about you don't make you successful.
Until you don't feel successful within!"
3620,2022-06-10 06:11:32+00:00,warikoo,"""I am already old""

You set targets for yourself.
And then imposed timelines on them.
Which were frankly desires and had no basis.
So when you didn't hit them by the time you thought you would, you feel you have lost.

Truth is - you have time!
You're not old. You're early."
3621,2022-06-10 06:11:31+00:00,warikoo,"""I haven't achieved anything so far""

You will compare yourself to others.
Other's success will scare you, agonize you, mock you.
You will look at where you are and feel you are nowhere. 

Truth is - in your 20s your position doesn't matter.
Your direction does."
3622,2022-06-10 06:11:31+00:00,warikoo,"""I am stuck""

You will fail.
You will have self-doubt.
You will suffer.
You will experience pain.
You will feel paralyzed.
You will feel helpless.

Truth is - you are not stuck.
You can always take the smallest possible step to get you out of where you are right now."
3623,2022-06-10 06:11:30+00:00,warikoo,"""I need lots of money. NOW""

Most of us, especially those who grew up with lack of money, want to get rich. Quickly.
We optimize for that.
We run after money.
Fall for short-term gains.

Truth is - 20s is the decade to focus on your learning.
Money is then a side effect."
3624,2022-06-10 06:11:29+00:00,warikoo,"""I need to settle""

20s is the decade that the world tells us to settle.
Finish your education.
Get a job.
Get married.
Have kids.
Buy that house/car.
Settle!

Truth is - 20s is the decade to explore.
To find out what you are good at and what makes you happy.
To not rush."
3625,2022-06-10 06:11:29+00:00,warikoo,"""I am a loser""

All our lives, especially in our 20s, we feel we are the odd ones out.
Everyone else has it figured.
Everyone else is smart.
Everyone else is so certain.

There must be something wrong with us.

Truth is - everyone feels the same way!"

I hope this thread is the start of fixing those mistakes."
3743,2022-06-03 06:30:11+00:00,warikoo,"Combine these 3 things
1. Seek mentors close to your experience levels
2. Seek multiple mentors for different areas
3. Seek mentors who are different from you

&amp; it doesn't look so hard to find one.

Because now you are not looking for THE mentor.
You are looking for a mentor."
3744,2022-06-03 06:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Seek mentors who are different from you.

They will show you a different side. 
They will ask questions you wouldn't ask otherwise.
They will make you a better version of yourself, not just a bigger version of yourself."
3745,2022-06-03 06:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"They are so different from me that every conversation with them is like opening myself to a whole new world.

They call me out, they are brutal yet honest, they care about me but do not use empathy to ruin me.

Fact?
Both of them are younger to me."
3746,2022-06-03 06:30:09+00:00,warikoo,"Until I realized, they see the problem the same way that I do.
What they have is experience.
What they lack is a different perspective.

Today, I seek people very different from me.
My mentors in entrepreneurship are 2 dear friends, who started up around the same time I did."
3747,2022-06-03 06:30:09+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 3: I sought mentors who were like me

Humans are animals of association.
We love to spend time with people who are like us.
Who agree with us, endorse our point of view, think like us, act like us.

I sought the same from my mentors."
3748,2022-06-03 06:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Have mentors. Several of them.

The ones who judgement you trust, in their field of brilliance.

Have one for career, one for money, one for relationships, one for anything you want in addition."
3749,2022-06-03 06:30:07+00:00,warikoo,"That's unfair.
It is too much pressure on one person.
You are setting them up for failure and yourself for disappointment.

Today, I have several mentors.
For different fields.
I am able to draw the best from the best.

Confession?
My best mentors do not even know me!"
3750,2022-06-03 06:30:07+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 2: I sought ""the one"" mentor

Growing up, I found it so fascinating that the most successful people always that this one mentor that changed their life.
That one guy who has stuck with them all along.

I wanted to find that one mentor.
The one who could solve everything."
3751,2022-06-03 06:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Seek mentors who are slightly ahead of you.
Who would have recently experienced what you are going through right now.
Or have the rare ability to speak to you in a language you understand."
3752,2022-06-03 06:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"So,
1. They will rarely share it, thinking it's so obvious.
2. You will constantly feel like a fool, for not understanding them
3. The relationship is doomed!"
3753,2022-06-03 06:30:05+00:00,warikoo,"If you seek a mentor who is far ahead of you, they will fail.
Because they wouldn't know whether is or isn't obvious to you.

They have experienced so much in life, that a lot of their learnings have been habits.
They do not realize they learnt it.
They live them now."
3754,2022-06-03 06:30:04+00:00,warikoo,"As a science student, I remember dreaming of Stephen Hawking as my mentor. 

I laugh at this today, not for the audacity but the foolishness of this dream."
3755,2022-06-03 06:30:04+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 1. I sought ""aspirational"" mentors

If you wish to startup and I ask you, who would you want as a mentor, most will name the usual suspects.
The billionaires, the unicorn founders, the ones in the limelight.

That's the mistake I made as well."

4204,2022-05-06 05:59:37+00:00,warikoo,"I realized this much later in life. Made so many mistakes with my money. 

So all of what I share is not from a point of expertise, instead a point of failing at doing the same things that I wish for you to do.

4205,2022-05-06 05:59:37+00:00,warikoo,"The biggest tragedy of the world we live in, is how much of our life we spend thinking about money. 

The biggest joy of investing is that if done right, consistently and patiently, you can actually spend your life living and not thinking about money!

Your money works for you."
4206,2022-05-06 05:59:36+00:00,warikoo,"Here are some books that I recommend

The Intelligent Investor

4207,2022-05-06 05:59:35+00:00,warikoo,"PS: If you open a demat account on Zerodha using the link above, I earn a brokerage income (no additional cost to you) - 100% of which is used to sponsor the education of kids that cannot afford it.

Last year we gave away 36L as support, which was 100% of our affiliate income."
4208,2022-05-06 05:59:35+00:00,warikoo,"Here are all the apps I use

Zerodha (for Indian stocks)
https://t.co/NkSMQVZCdj

@smallcaseHQ for buying portfolio of stocks
@INDmoneyApp for buying US stocks
@CoinByZerodha for buying mutual funds
@WintWealth for corporate bonds
@WazirXIndia for crypto"
4209,2022-05-06 05:59:34+00:00,warikoo,"I only buy 3 Crypto - Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

I make my investments in the ratio of 100:10:1, so if I have Rs. 5,000 to spare I will buy BTC worth 4500, ETH worth 450 and SOL worth 50."
4210,2022-05-06 05:59:33+00:00,warikoo,"Bonus 7
If you can take some risk

Of the X that you invest outside of equity, put 2/3rd of it into fixed income (gold, bonds, EPF, PPF etc) and invest 1/3rd into Crypto.

I believe in its future, but please don't take my word for it.
Invest only if you are ok losing all of it."
4211,2022-05-06 05:59:33+00:00,warikoo,"These 6 steps, if clinically followed, can kickstart your investing journey. Key is to start. 

You will not know all the answers on Day1, but the journey will teach you a lot about how you view money and your relationship with it."
4212,2022-05-06 05:59:32+00:00,warikoo,"Just don't keep this money in the bank or an FD.

With inflation at 6% and taxes at (say) 20%, you need a return higher than 7.5% to beat inflation. 
So anything around 9-10% should be pretty good (real-estate, for higher income categories)"
4213,2022-05-06 05:59:31+00:00,warikoo,"Corporate Bonds is another option (think FDs, but higher return and issued by companies).
They need to be very carefully vetted, because risk of losing all money is high.
Wint Wealth, GoldenPi do a good job.

PPF/EPF are also good options, but come with long-term lock-in."
4214,2022-05-06 05:59:31+00:00,warikoo,"6. Where to invest the rest?

You invested 100-X in equities. The rest should be parked in safer-lower-return assets.

Digital Gold (not jewelry) can be an option. 
Opt for Sovereign Gold Bonds; offers addn 2.5% return over and above gold price return.

4215,2022-05-06 05:59:30+00:00,warikoo,"Here are the returns of Nifty50 since 2000.

3yr return: 13.1%
5yr return: 13.5%
10yr return: 11.5%
20yr return: 15.1%

Again, plenty to chose from - HDFC, Navi etc https://t.co/Os05GlmBZ1"
4216,2022-05-06 05:59:28+00:00,warikoo,"5b. Invest in an index fund
Picking standalone stocks is hard and requires expertise.
Index funds tracks the best stocks as a portfolio and for a very small fee you get an experienced manager to do it for you.

Nifty50 is a great index. It tracks the top 50 stocks of the NSE."
4217,2022-05-06 05:59:27+00:00,warikoo,"5. How much to invest in equity?

If your age is X, then 100-X should be invested in equities.
So 75% of your investment amt in equities, if you are aged 25. 

How?
5a. Open a demat account
There are plenty to chose from - Zerodha, Groww, 5Paisa, Upstox etc"
4218,2022-05-06 05:59:26+00:00,warikoo,"4. Save ALL possible taxes

Once can (and should) save a lot of taxes by investing in assets that are deducted from our taxable income.

ELSS (equity-linked-savings-scheme), EPF, PPF, NPS, your insurance premiums - all fall under 80C deductions upto 1.5L/yr

Do these investments!"
4219,2022-05-06 05:59:26+00:00,warikoo,"...this ratio should ideally keep changing every year.

So every year, if you get an increment in salary, or increase your income, turn the ratio around.

Allocate 50% of your increase to your investments, keep 30% intact for wants, and 20% towards needs.

I invest 30%/mth."
4220,2022-05-06 05:59:25+00:00,warikoo,"3. How much to invest every month?

Start with a basic 50:30:20 rule
50% of your monthly income towards your needs (EMI/Rent, food, utilities, bills etc) and no more.
30% towards your wants (phone, car, vacation, gadgets etc)
20% minimum invested.

However, with remote working..."
4221,2022-05-06 05:59:24+00:00,warikoo,"Your emergency fund should be minimum 6X and ideally 12X of that amount.

Park 70% in an FD (make sure there are no charges to liquidate, when needed); 20% in your saving account and 10% in cash.

Build for this, before you start investing."
4222,2022-05-06 05:59:24+00:00,warikoo,"2. Build an emergency fund

Investing is a long term patient game. No point investing for that if you cannot manage emergencies in the present. 

Calculate your monthly expense for your needs.
EMI/Rent, food, utilities, bills.
Don't include investments and things you wish to buy."
4223,2022-05-06 05:59:23+00:00,warikoo,"Buy life insurance. 
NOT for investment; purely for protection. 
A term plan is the best in this case.

Take a cover that is minimum 15X of your annual salary and ideally 25X.
Take it until retirement age.

I have a 10Cr term plan, bought when I was 31 (I am 42 today)."
4224,2022-05-06 05:59:22+00:00,warikoo,"So if average hospital cost per day is 10K/day, then buy a 3L cover for your family and a 4.5L cover for your parents. 

I have a 9L cover for my family and a 15L cover for my parents."
4225,2022-05-06 05:59:22+00:00,warikoo,"1. Before investing, protect yourself and your family.

Buy health insurance for your immediate family (spouse/kids) and a separate one for your parents/in-laws. 

Based on where you live, buy a cover that pays for 30days hospitalization for your family and 45days for parents."

4310,2022-04-29 06:30:14+00:00,warikoo,"16. Struggle to quote your price?

Share a specific price, as against a round figure.
1.47 seems like a legitimate, thought-through number as against 1.5"
4311,2022-04-29 06:30:14+00:00,warikoo,"15. Buy things and then regret?

If unsure whether you should buy it or not, wait for 30 days and then ask yourself if you still need the thing.
Quite likely you won't anymore."
4312,2022-04-29 06:30:13+00:00,warikoo,"14. Caught in office politics?

Compliment people behind their back.
The news will eventually travel to them.

People find it hard to fight people who compliment them."
4313,2022-04-29 06:30:12+00:00,warikoo,"13. Struggle to focus while listening to music?

Any song with lyrics will take our attention away. 
Instead, listen to instrumental music (ideally classical music)."
4314,2022-04-29 06:30:12+00:00,warikoo,"12. Lose people's attention easily?

While speaking to them, include their name in your sentences.

We instantly react to our names, thus bringing our attention back to the conversation."
4315,2022-04-29 06:30:11+00:00,warikoo,"11. Struggle with procrastination?

Think of the task you have to finish, right before you go to sleep. Better still, think of the end of the task.

Your brain will mentally start mapping the path to finish it. Once up, this will make it easier for you to finish the task"
4316,2022-04-29 06:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"10. Want to learn something?

Teach it to somebody else. 
It works, even if you are fake teaching (recording yourself, while you teach)"
4317,2022-04-29 06:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"9. Feel under-confident?

Trick your mind with powerful reinforcements. 
Instead of saying ""I think"" or ""I am not sure"" say ""I believe"" or ""I am certain""."
4318,2022-04-29 06:30:09+00:00,warikoo,"8a: Bonus tip

Put time blockers on the apps you waste most time on.
Let your family/friend lock it with a PIN, which they do not share with you."
4319,2022-04-29 06:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"8. Waste a lot of time on the phone?

Schedule ""waste"" time on your calendar, just as you would schedule your productive hours.

Your brain anticipates it, looks forward to it and treats it as reward."
4320,2022-04-29 06:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"7. Struggle to invest?

Whenever you spend on anything that is a desire/wish (clothes, phone, eating out etc), transfer an equivalent amount to a separate bank account. 

This way you will enjoy your present, while planning for the future."
4321,2022-04-29 06:30:07+00:00,warikoo,"6. Want people to like you?

Repeat what they said, back to them.

""To make sure I heard you right, you are saying XXX (repeat what they said)""

They feel heard, they respect your listening skills - the mirroring helps."
4322,2022-04-29 06:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"5. Struggle to express gratitude?

Keep a gratitude jar

Everyday, before going to bed, write down something that you are grateful for.
Anything at all.

Place it in the jar.

In moments of weakness, go through the notes."
4323,2022-04-29 06:30:05+00:00,warikoo,"4. Struggle to manage your docs and thoughts?

Create a WhatsApp group with you and a friend.  
Delete the friend.
Now the group has only you. 
Pin the group to the top.

Use this group for sharing thoughts, capturing images, voice notes to yourself, whatever you want it to be!"
4324,2022-04-29 06:30:05+00:00,warikoo,"3. Do not deal well with failure?

Practice failing.
Everyday, pick up a task that is not significant, but has a high chance of failure.
And do it.

Ask strangers for money.
Send cold emails.

Within 30 days, you will start dealing with failure a lot better."
4325,2022-04-29 06:30:04+00:00,warikoo,"2. People think you are self obsessed?

Whenever someone shares anything about their life, resist the urge to share your own experience around it, unless asked.

Avoid ""me too"", ""I also do this"", ""I was thinking exactly the same""."

4460,2022-04-22 05:38:41+00:00,warikoo,"...they consciously chose to do the things that make them feel good, in a repeated fashion.

The most brilliant artists have what might look like no routine.
They wake up, do something, take a nap, wake up, do their work, go for a walk.

Might not look like a routine.
But it is."
4461,2022-04-22 05:38:41+00:00,warikoo,"A routine isn't discipline around tasks. 
It is disciple around emotions.

The most successful people have a routine.
That doesn't mean they are always working, or have things lined up back to back.

It means, they know which tasks make them feel what way.
And..."
4462,2022-04-22 05:38:40+00:00,warikoo,"This video by @jordanbpeterson beautifully describes why we should all have a routine.

Short clip - give it a watch.
https://t.co/6QrgcZpQKd"
4463,2022-04-22 05:38:39+00:00,warikoo,"Because I sleep early, I have consciously said no to a gazillion dinners and events.

That was a price I was more than willing to pay.
But it is still a price I have to pay.

And you will have to too.
Assess the price.
If ok, great.
If not, reassess the routine."
4464,2022-04-22 05:38:39+00:00,warikoo,"9. A routine will be costly. 

When you do things as per a routine, you are also in some saying no to spontaneity. 
That needn't be an entirely bad thing, but could feel bad often.

The emotional cost of sticking to a routine is high."
4465,2022-04-22 05:38:38+00:00,warikoo,"I used to read early morning.
Now I read right before I go to bed.

I used to play tennis and workout alternate days.
Now I do it everyday.

I used to meditate for 10mins (for 2+ years)
Now I meditate for 30+ mins 

Time you spend on yourself, is energy you give yourself."
4466,2022-04-22 05:38:37+00:00,warikoo,"8. You will change. Thus, your routine needs to as well.

A routine is not a destination.
It is a tool for you to become a better version of yourself.
And as you walk on that path, the tools you require will also change.
Be aware of that change."
4467,2022-04-22 05:38:37+00:00,warikoo,"I have been on this morning routine for 5+ years now, ever since I started actively meditating and playing tennis.

It took me 3+ years to go from 7am wake-up time to 430ish wake-up time (improving by ~10mins every 3 weeks)"
4468,2022-04-22 05:38:36+00:00,warikoo,"7. Give it time

Routines are planned overnight.
They happen over years.
Be patient with them.

If you feel a sense of progress, you will need lesser and lesser motivation to persist.
Set no deadline to make a routine happen."
4469,2022-04-22 05:38:35+00:00,warikoo,"My wife, for instance, goes to play tennis at 515am (under the lights), while I meditate, sing and get the kids ready for school.

Once she is back, I leave for my tennis while she drops the kids to the bus stop and goes to the gym.

Works for both of us."
4470,2022-04-22 05:38:35+00:00,warikoo,"6. Do not have a routine in isolation

It becomes hard if your routine is in conflict with those you live with.

Bring them along.
Adjust if you have to.
Request them to as well.

What may seem like a compromise is still far better than not having a routine at all."
4471,2022-04-22 05:38:34+00:00,warikoo,"...ask yourself, how do these things make me feel?

The key is to do things for yourself, that give you energy, so that you have enough to dispense on things that you will have to do for others."
4472,2022-04-22 05:38:33+00:00,warikoo,"5. Measure progress in terms of energy, not goals

It is hard to quantify the impact of activities such as meditation, reading, walking, painting etc 
And thus its easy to conclude that they do not move you towards a goal.

That may not be the right metric.
Instead..."
4473,2022-04-22 05:38:33+00:00,warikoo,"4. Schedule those things, as a process

Once you have identified the things that give you energy, set a process.
It may seem boring, clinical, robotic, but remember, these things give you energy.

You do not have to do them.
You WANT to do them."
4474,2022-04-22 05:38:32+00:00,warikoo,"3. Do things that GIVE you energy

The key to a routine, is to recharge yourself.
To gather energy.
Either from within or external sources.

For me, it is meditating and riyaaz (singing). 
For my wife, it is tennis and gardening.

Identify what it is for you."
4475,2022-04-22 05:38:31+00:00,warikoo,"Take your time to wake up.

What works for me is sipping a glass of water for 10 mins.
Just me.
No phone, no person, no book, nothing.

The key is NOT to activate all your senses instantly. 
Take it slow."
4476,2022-04-22 05:38:31+00:00,warikoo,"2. Wake up slowly

Kids are often a good reflection of how we should behave as adults.
How they wake up is something we should learn.

Kids rarely jump out of their bed.
They stretch, slowly open their eyes, don't start talking, instead reply in humming sounds.

Do the same."
4477,2022-04-22 05:38:30+00:00,warikoo,"1a. Try and have your meals at least 2 hours  and preferably 4 hours earlier than you sleep

1b. Try and not have any screen time for 30 mins before you sleep

1c. Try and not get your mind excited by any activity (for instance, thriller fiction books). Instead calm it down."
4478,2022-04-22 05:38:29+00:00,warikoo,"1. Sleep on time

The key to a morning routine, is to wake up the same time everyday.
The single biggest determinant of that, is your sleeping time.

If you sleep sporadically, you will struggle to wake up consistently at the same time."
4479,2022-04-22 05:38:29+00:00,warikoo,"Here are 9 steps towards building a morning routine, if that's what you wish to do"
4480,2022-04-22 05:38:28+00:00,warikoo,"You can chose your time. 

Let nobody guilt trip you into waking up early. 
If nights are productive for you, build a routine around that.

It is far more important to have a routine for your day, than to force yourself to wake up early."
4481,2022-04-22 05:38:27+00:00,warikoo,"For the longest time, I was an inconsistent riser.

School was 6am (school bus was early), college was 7am (had to reach campus by 830), work was 8am (rushed to reach office by 9).

It was only when I became an entrepreneur, that I settled into a routine.
And I chose morning."
4482,2022-04-22 05:38:27+00:00,warikoo,"First, why does (any) routine work?

To have a routine is to train your mind and body on a repeated process.
Once the mind and body gets used to it, and begins to experience a sense of progress, it requires lesser and lesser motivation to repeat the same task."
4483,2022-04-22 05:38:26+00:00,warikoo,"Yesterday, in response to a question, I shared my morning routine on Twitter.

4696,2022-04-08 07:03:25+00:00,warikoo,"So do not wish for your haters to go away. Do not give them the joy of a special position in your world and your thoughts. 

Instead, pray for their well being. 
Realize that for every such hater, there is an admirer as well.
Be aware of them. Do not chase them."
4697,2022-04-08 07:03:24+00:00,warikoo,"Peace isn't being perpetually happy.
It is being divorced from wanting to be perpetually happy."
4698,2022-04-08 07:03:24+00:00,warikoo,"To embrace both positivity and negativity as a reality, without any emotional attachment or aversion, is ironically the only way to gather peace."

But to define positivity."
4701,2022-04-08 07:03:22+00:00,warikoo,"I wouldn't reproduce them, because that would be too cocky. 

Visualize this... 
People thanking us.
Sharing how our content pulled them out of their darkest moments.
Helped them connect with their lost relationships, including the one they had with themselves."
4702,2022-04-08 07:03:21+00:00,warikoo,"Instead, do not seek positivity either.

Remember, our Google drive has a folder called life-changing?

It contains precious emails and messages from people who thank us for the work we do. How we have helped them change their life."
4703,2022-04-08 07:03:20+00:00,warikoo,"We try and run away from negativity, towards positivity, but it is futile.

Because positivity is the awareness of negativity, the acceptance of negativity, the acknowledgement of it."
4704,2022-04-08 07:03:20+00:00,warikoo,"As long as we are chasing positivity, we cannot ignore negativity. 

When we say we do not want negativity in our life, we are admitting to understanding the definition of negativity. 
And its impact on us."

There is a strong chance it will. 

If it doesn't, here is the 4th bonus approach."
4706,2022-04-08 07:03:18+00:00,warikoo,"And I kid you not, I found myself feeling so terribly sorry for this person. 

Because this person might not have anyone to speak to. No one to share what they are going through. 
So much so that they decided to send such an anger filled note to some random dude on the internet."
4707,2022-04-08 07:03:18+00:00,warikoo,"I was imaging the life of this individual. 

Did they sleep at all? Did they just wake up? Did they see something that triggered this reaction? It can't be just me. 

This person must have a really hard life.
They must be really angry.
Not at me.
Not at themselves.
At life!"

When we fail, we are either blamed, or we are absolved of it because it was someone else's fault.

When we fall as a toddler, it is the floor that is beaten up.

So we rarely grow up to take responsibility for our actions."
5024,2022-03-18 05:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"10. Imposing relationships

We are often ordered to maintain relationships, simply because we were born into them. 
Even if those relationships do not work for us.

Thus a lot of us grow up with a complicated relationship with our own selves.
""Is there something wrong with me?"""
5025,2022-03-18 05:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"9. Unreasonable expectations

Because our parents had a difficult different life, they often wish to experience life through their kids.

Thus imposing expectations that we did not get to chose for ourselves.

What is success for us, is often defined without our permission."
5026,2022-03-18 05:30:07+00:00,warikoo,"8. No discussion about Money

Most of us grow up with zero understanding of income, expenses, taxes, investments.

And thus have a complicated relationship with money that we understand much later.
By which time it is often late."
5027,2022-03-18 05:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"7. Lack of trust

In a trust-deficient society, parents tend to start with mistrust than trust. 

""Daal mein kuch kaala hai"" (there is something wrong) is the operative we are raised on.

We are rarely trusted.
So we grow up to rarely trust."
5028,2022-03-18 05:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"6.  Dismissing Mental Health

Mental health wasn't a topic for our parents, growing up.
People were sent to mental hospitals.

So it is easy for them to dismiss mental health as either a fad (""you can come out of it if you want to"") or a illness to be ashamed of."
5029,2022-03-18 05:30:04+00:00,warikoo,"4. Looking at the world only through their own experiences

Our parents had a very different and difficult life.
Which, for no fault of theirs, has biased them.

The world has changed though.
Their biases haven't."
5030,2022-03-18 05:30:04+00:00,warikoo,"3. Focusing on society

Society is somehow more important than us. 
What we do in life, who we marry, how we dress, where we work.

Decisions that should be ours, become decisions driven by others. 
Faceless people, who opinions are apparently more important than our feelings."
5031,2022-03-18 05:30:03+00:00,warikoo,"2. Killing curiosity

As kids all that we did was ask questions. 
Before we were told not to.

Asking means we do not understand. 
Asking means we are dumb. 
Asking means we admit to being dumb.
So don't ask.

We stop asking.
We memorize answers.
Instead of loving questions."
5032,2022-03-18 05:30:02+00:00,warikoo,"1. Comparison

We are often compared to others, in the hope that it elevates our game. 

However, the constant comparison makes us feel that nothing we do will be good enough. 
Because there will always be someone to compare ourselves with!"

They get us started. 
And starting is a great thing!"
5203,2022-03-04 06:22:33+00:00,warikoo,"25. Take breaks

Our mind gets distracted.
Give it some space.

Follow the pomodoro technique.
25 mins of work
5 mins break
Repeat
After 2-4 of such Pomodoros, take a longer 20 min break."
5204,2022-03-04 06:22:33+00:00,warikoo,"24. Teach people

When you teach something, your own understanding of what you are teaching gets better."
5205,2022-03-04 06:22:32+00:00,warikoo,"23. Follow positive thoughts

Unfollow those who make you laugh at other people's expense, those who make you feel jealous, though you make you feel ugly or incapable, those who spread hatred and anger.

You are the 5 ideas you spend most time with."
5206,2022-03-04 06:22:31+00:00,warikoo,"22. Smile at the mirror

Say good morning to yourself
Good night
I love you
You are enough

Or say nothing. 
Look at yourself in the eye.
And just smile :)"
5207,2022-03-04 06:22:31+00:00,warikoo,"21. Help strangers

When out, if you see somebody who needs help, help them.

Helping those you do not know, makes you feel good about yourself.
You know you have nothing to gain from it."
5208,2022-03-04 06:22:30+00:00,warikoo,"20. Every night, look at the stars for 2 mins

Just you, and the sky. 
No clicking pictures.
No one else.
No music.
Nothing.

Just look at the stars. 
Imagine how big the world is.
How there is space for everything and everyone.
Including you!"
5209,2022-03-04 06:22:29+00:00,warikoo,"19. Write angry letters. But don't send them.

Whenever angry, write down all that you are feeling. Record your voice, if writing is hard. Give your emotions an outlet.

And then don't destroy them."
5210,2022-03-04 06:22:29+00:00,warikoo,"18. Keep a gratitude jar

Everyday, before going to bed, write down something that you are grateful for.

Place it in the jar.

In moments of weakness, go through the notes."
5211,2022-03-04 06:22:28+00:00,warikoo,"17. Don't buy water

Carry a bottle with you, wherever you go.

It will be way cheaper
You will get covered for much longer"
5213,2022-03-04 06:22:26+00:00,warikoo,"15. Use credit cards

They offer 30-45 days free credit
They give you rewards points
They help you with your credit rating

However, always, ALWAYS pay the bill in full."
5214,2022-03-04 06:22:25+00:00,warikoo,"14. Lower the tenure, not the EMI

If your interest rate reduces, do not lower the EMI. Lower the tenure of the loan.

If you find a cheaper interest rate, opt for it.

Do whatever you can, to save on interest paid!"
5215,2022-03-04 06:22:25+00:00,warikoo,"13. The 30-day rule

When you desire a big purchase, do not buy it right away.
Give yourself 30 days and ask yourself if you still it just as much as you did earlier.

If you do, go for it.
Chances are you won't."
5216,2022-03-04 06:22:24+00:00,warikoo,"12. Do not put pressure on your hobby to make money

Pursue it through a side gig. 
Let it give you joy.

Take your time.

The day your side income replaces your main income, quit your job!"
5217,2022-03-04 06:22:24+00:00,warikoo,"11. If you have a loan, increase your EMI by 5% every year and pay 1 extra EMI every year

Your 25 year loan will now be paid in 13 years!"
5218,2022-03-04 06:22:23+00:00,warikoo,"10. Have a separate bank account for investments

The day you get your monthly salary, auto-transfer atleast 20% of that to the investment bank account.

You have to manage with the rest. Go figure!"
5219,2022-03-04 06:22:22+00:00,warikoo,"9. Don't watch news

News is meant to scintillate you, in the guise of information.

News will convince you the world is falling apart, while making you feel guilty for not doing anything about it."
5220,2022-03-04 06:22:21+00:00,warikoo,"8. Create a self-whatsapp group

Create a WA group with you and your best friend. 
Delete the best friend. Now the group has only you.
Pin the group to the top.

Use this group for sharing thoughts, capturing images, voice notes to yourself, whatever you want it to be!"
5221,2022-03-04 06:22:21+00:00,warikoo,"7. Put timer limits for apps where you waste time

Protect the timer limits by a passcode.
Let your family/friends decide the passcode and not share it with you.

When time is up, it is up!"
5222,2022-03-04 06:22:20+00:00,warikoo,"6. Always ask for ""by when do you need this?""

Whenever given a task, even if an order, always check for the deadline.

Very often we have a different definition of urgency in our minds."
5223,2022-03-04 06:22:19+00:00,warikoo,"5. Address people by their names

When drafting a message or email, or replying to one, when saying hello or replying to their hello, say out people's names.

You will never forget it then.
And they will feel loved!"
5224,2022-03-04 06:22:19+00:00,warikoo,"4. Predict your future (and then laugh about it)

Every birthday, write down 2-3 predictions for yourself, for the next year. 

And then next birthday, go through them.

Over 3-5 years you will be amazed at how inaccurate your predictions were!"
5225,2022-03-04 06:22:18+00:00,warikoo,"3. Do not try to remember anything! 

Write everything down. 
Put things on a calendar.
Create a to-do list.
Use a notes app.

We over-estimate our ability to remember things!"
5226,2022-03-04 06:22:17+00:00,warikoo,"2. Send emails to your future self.

It could be a task, a prediction, a thought. Compose the email and schedule send it for sometime later. 

It is joyful when we have forgotten about something and then hear from our own selves."
5227,2022-03-04 06:22:17+00:00,warikoo,"1. When speaking to others, try and notice the color of their eye balls.

https://t.co/tmTKYvK3hB

Retweet the start of this thread and I will randomly select 5 of you, to gift this book."
5539,2022-02-11 05:30:18+00:00,warikoo,"Your 20s are your ""selfish"" years. Its a decade to immerse yourself into every single thing possible. 

Be selfish with your time, and all the aspects of you.

Tinker with shit, travel, explore, love a lot, love a little, and never touch the ground. 

- Kyoko Escamilia"
5540,2022-02-11 05:30:17+00:00,warikoo,"I learnt most of these 20 lessons the hard way. 
And much later in life.

I wish someone has sat me down and explain the process of growing up. 

I wish there was a ""Guide to growing up"" published somewhere.

In the absence of it, this thread is a start. 
Hopefully not the end!"
5541,2022-02-11 05:30:17+00:00,warikoo,"The 20s is the defining decade for most of us.

It is in this decade we find our most meaningful relationships, we start our careers, we handle money, we manage our own selves and we handle people at scale.

It is also the decade we are least trained for!"
5542,2022-02-11 05:30:16+00:00,warikoo,"20. If you abuse your body, you wouldn't realize the harm until much later.

Don't treat your body as a waste bin.
Don't ignore the signs.
Don't postpone healing yourself to tomorrow.

You shouldn't need an accident to tell you that you are damaged."
5543,2022-02-11 05:30:15+00:00,warikoo,"19. Don't optimize for money. Optimize for learning.

This decade:
- If you learn at the expense of money, you will earn a lot more in the future than you imagined.
- If you earn at the expense of learning, you will have to keep earning and learning for the rest of your life!"
5544,2022-02-11 05:30:15+00:00,warikoo,"18. Your self-esteem is yours to nurture. Not for others to define.

But others will define it for you.
And you will outsource your self-esteem to them.
Until the day they leave and you will be left with no self-esteem.

Love yourself.
Respect yourself.
Nurture yourself."
5545,2022-02-11 05:30:14+00:00,warikoo,"17. Keep asking questions, even if you think it annoys people

Only those who ask questions move forward.
Rest everyone accepts the answer society has given them!"
5546,2022-02-11 05:30:13+00:00,warikoo,"16. A person isn't nice because they are nice to you. They are nice because they are nice to everyone, especially those they don't need to be nice to! 

Notice yourself when you start falling for people, just because they are nice to you!

Observe how they treat everyone."
5547,2022-02-11 05:30:12+00:00,warikoo,"15. Talking about people will never take you far. Talking about ideas will.

Surround yourself with people who talk ideas.
Take yourself out from circles where you are simply talking about people!"
5548,2022-02-11 05:30:12+00:00,warikoo,"14. Your  goals are merely desires

Goals are weird.
We hit them - feel great.
We don't hit them - feel shitty.
But when we set them, there is no basis for it.
Only a desire.

Don't set goals.
Set habits.
And they will take you to far great goals you could have set for yourself."
5549,2022-02-11 05:30:11+00:00,warikoo,"13. Be aware of what you are feeling

20s is when we are feeling the most. Because so much around us is constantly changing.

Don't try to control your emotions.
Instead be aware of them.

Why am I angry/sad/scared/excited/happy/nervous?

Make your mind your friend. Not enemy."
5550,2022-02-11 05:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"12. If people like you, life will be much easier.

Be kind.
Be generous.
Compliment people.
Help people.
Do it for no returns.
And you will get massive returns!"
5551,2022-02-11 05:30:09+00:00,warikoo,"10. You are responsible ONLY for your happiness. Not that of others.

Other people's baggage is theirs to deal with.
Acknowledge them.
Empathize with them.
Support them.
But allow them to work things out on their own."
5552,2022-02-11 05:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"9. Don't make money to spend. Make it to retire. 

If you earn to spend, you will be forced to earn all your life.
If you earn to free yourself from earning, you will be able to do whatever you want to do.
For the rest of your life!"
5553,2022-02-11 05:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"8. Life will move really fast. Don't let it.

Do not live your life as if its happening to you.
Eat. Work. Sleep. Repeat.

Pursue hobbies, learn, connect with people, work out, read, exercise, meditate, think, wake up / sleep on time, do things outside of work.  
LIVE LIFE!"
5554,2022-02-11 05:30:07+00:00,warikoo,"7. Everyone in their 20s thinks they are too old.

But you are not.
You are really really early!
You are just getting started.
You have time to figure things out.

The pressure of time is self imposed."
5555,2022-02-11 05:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"6. Nothing expects you to be sorted. But you will believe you are the only one who is not!

The most binding trait of all those in their 20s, is that all of them are trying to make sense of their life.
No one has it figured."
5556,2022-02-11 05:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"5. It is the only decade where 

- you are big enough to take big risks, and
- have a life long enough to recover if those risks do not work out

Take risks. 
You will be surprised at how many of them work out.
Or how easily you get over them."
5557,2022-02-11 05:30:05+00:00,warikoo,"4. Most life plans do not work out. And that's part of the plan!

Things will change. 
You will change.
The world will change.
And thus your plans will change.

When they do, embrace the new you. 
It is telling you something."
5558,2022-02-11 05:30:04+00:00,warikoo,"3. You do not have to be an extrovert to win.

Extroversion/Introversion has nothing to do with people. Instead it is how you gain energy. From people, or from within.

If you are introvert, strengthen yourself instead of wanting to change yourself."
5559,2022-02-11 05:30:04+00:00,warikoo,"2. The world will do everything to dictate a timeline for your life. 

Finish studies by 24
Get married by 27
Kids by 30

If you listen to the world, you will live their life. 
Not yours."
5560,2022-02-11 05:30:03+00:00,warikoo,"1. It is ok to not feel connected anymore with your school/college friends. 

It is better to acknowledge it and express it, than to slowly drift apart and live with the guilt ""did I do it right?"""

Most of the stories you have been told about adulting are wrong.

A lot of independence.
A lot of connections.
A lot of discovery.

5564,2022-02-10 09:44:03+00:00,warikoo,"True happiness rarely leads to complacency. 

You do things that make you happy. And if something doesn't make you happy, you stop doing it and choose happiness someplace else."
5565,2022-02-10 04:13:16+00:00,warikoo,"If there were a community formed of my followers, what would be a good name for it? 

The selected name will get a Kindle.

PS2: The name should ideally also become the identity.

One thing I would highly recommend is reindexing. Pick your best performing last videos and change the title, thumbnail, tags, description (basically everything that can be changed).

1. How do you reward for performance, in this model? Reaction of your best performers to the 75% equitable distribution?

1. Reach out. It is your responsibility to do so, than theirs to check on you.

2. Be honest. If you lie to them or hide from them, you make them incapable to mentor you.

3. Have multiple mentors for different aspects of life. Unfair for one person to play all roles."
5743,2022-01-28 06:28:48+00:00,warikoo,"Mentor:

1. Don't solve their problems. Listen to their problems. 

2. Don't assume they know because you know. Remember who you were, when you were them.

3. Don't force down prescriptions. Share your opinion and ask them to consider."
5744,2022-01-28 06:28:48+00:00,warikoo,"Personal Finance Manager:

1. Protect yourself before starting to invest - life and health insurance.

2. Understand your risk and invest accordingly. Not everyone needs to invest in stocks or crypto.

3. Don't ever invest in FOMO. No money is worth it, if you lose sleep over it."
5745,2022-01-28 06:28:46+00:00,warikoo,"Team Member:

1. Spend time with people who are different from you. Ask ""what is it that they know that I don't.""

5746,2022-01-28 06:28:45+00:00,warikoo,"Employee:

1. Be eager to learn. Not to create impact.

2. If you see things happening that are not in line with how the CEO would conduct themselves, raise them.

3. Focus on the outcome (what am I supposed to achieve), as against the output (what am I supposed to do)"
5747,2022-01-28 06:28:44+00:00,warikoo,"Boyfriend/Girlfriend:

1. Listen, without judging. They should be 100% themselves when they are with you.

2. Don't make them feel bad for who they are or what they say. Don't change yourself as well.

3. You would WANT to make them happy. They shouldn't HAVE to make you happy."
5748,2022-01-28 06:28:44+00:00,warikoo,"Friend:

1. Be genuinely happy, when they succeed. Its the hardest thing to do.

2. Do not make your friend responsible for your own happiness. You are responsible!

3. Tell them the truth. Be honest with them. Even if they may not like it."
5749,2022-01-28 06:28:43+00:00,warikoo,"Student:

1. Learn the art of learning. Not just the subject. So that you can become a student whenever you want.

2. Understand by yourself. Absorb by discussing with peers. Amplify by teaching it back to others.

3. Write things down. Writing helps structure our thoughts."
5750,2022-01-28 06:28:42+00:00,warikoo,"Brother/Sister:

1. Share. Even if they don't. It is a beautiful value to build.

2. Support them. Encourage them. Be there for them. They are the only blood relationship that will most likely grow old with you.

3. Don't ever show them down in front of their friends. Ever!"
5751,2022-01-28 06:28:42+00:00,warikoo,"Son/Daughter:

1. Realize how their life experiences shaped them up.

2. Don't think they can do no wrong. They are humans first. Parents later.

3. Before you fight with them, realize they want the same things for you that you want for yourself. Its just a different path."
5752,2022-01-28 06:28:41+00:00,warikoo,"Parent:

1. Encourage them to ask questions. Be patient with those questions. Do not kill their curiosity. 

2. Thank them for telling the truth. Do not reprimand them. Else they will always lie.

3. Support them, when they fail. That's when they need you the most."

5867,2022-01-21 05:33:37+00:00,warikoo,"I've been a student of habits for as long as I have known myself.

Whether it was recording every waking hour of the day, since school, or reading (the same books over and over again, since that's all I could afford), or thinking in numbers for everything.

I am my habits."
5868,2022-01-21 05:33:37+00:00,warikoo,"When we pick something up for the first time, it is always hard. 
Our brain is active and it vividly consumes energy to navigate that path.

Once it becomes a habit, our brain dispenses the least energy to accomplish it.
Habits are nature's way to conserve energy!"
5869,2022-01-21 05:33:36+00:00,warikoo,"22. Ask yourself everyday, ""what am I doing wrong, that I know I am doing wrong?""

If you ask this question everyday, you will find the answer to your wrong.
You will know what you have to fix.

The answer will not be the one you want.
But it will be the one you need."
5870,2022-01-21 05:33:36+00:00,warikoo,"21. Call your parents

You have much lesser time left with them than you imagine.
And once they are gone, you do not want to live with regret."
5871,2022-01-21 05:33:36+00:00,warikoo,"20. Schedule your day. 
Including your ""I will waste time"" slots

Set time aside for work.
Also set time aside for no-work, for mindless scrolling, for random banter, for just chilling.

You will anticipate that time. And will become disciplined about it eventually."
5872,2022-01-21 05:33:35+00:00,warikoo,"19. Follow positive people

Unfollow those who make you laugh at the expense of others.
Unfollow those who make you hate the world.
Unfollow those who make you feel ugly/unworthy.
Unfollow those who make you lose hope.

You're the average of the 5 ideas you spend most time with."
5873,2022-01-21 05:33:35+00:00,warikoo,"18. Follow the POMODORO technique for work

25 mins of work
5 mins break
Repeat
After 5 such cycles, take a long 15 min break

Helps you focus.
Your focus is everything.
Focus in the new IQ!"
5874,2022-01-21 05:33:35+00:00,warikoo,"17. Work out everyday

Doesn't need to be the gym.
Do something that you can commit to everyday.
Run, swim, walk, dance, jump, play - anything that gets your heart beat racing and you sweating.

Feel alive!"
5875,2022-01-21 05:33:35+00:00,warikoo,"16. Compliment people

It will feel awkward, but only to you.
For the one receiving it, it might be the best thing they have heard in a while.

Do not hesitate."
5876,2022-01-21 05:33:34+00:00,warikoo,"14. Breathe deeply through your nose, let go through your mouth. 2 mins everyday.

Our breath is EVERYTHING! 
Paying attention to it, is the first step to realizing this."
5877,2022-01-21 05:33:34+00:00,warikoo,"13. Act on the thoughts that keep you up at night

We all have ideas. Only a few of us have something to show.
Do not let your best ideas die within.

Take the smallest possible step that you can.
DO is the start of DO EPIC SHIT."
5878,2022-01-21 05:33:34+00:00,warikoo,"12. Do one thing every week where you are likely to fail

We all fear failing.
Practice failing and we won't fear it anymore.

Ask for a favor from a stranger, send a cold email, sing in public, give a mock interview.

Practice failing. So that failing doesn't hurt."
5879,2022-01-21 05:33:33+00:00,warikoo,"11. Before emotions, bring numbers in

Emotions will eventually play a key role in every decision.
Before you let them take over, do the math.

Should you buy the house or rent, buy the car or rent, take up that job or this, move abroad or stay here - start with the numbers."
5880,2022-01-21 05:33:33+00:00,warikoo,"10. Invest every month

The amount doesn't matter.
The market conditions doesn't matter.

How long you invest matters.
How regularly you invest matters.

No more excuses."
5881,2022-01-21 05:33:33+00:00,warikoo,"9. Make inspiration a choice

Don't leave inspiration to chance.
Do something everyday that leaves you inspired.
That video, that song, that quote, that podcast, that book, that person.

Actively choose inspiration.
The algorithms may never chose it for you!"
5882,2022-01-21 05:33:33+00:00,warikoo,"8. Say thank you. Even when someone can't hear you.

Saying thank you is to have good manners.
Being thankful is to have a good life.

Pause a second to close your eyes and be thankful towards someone who did something for you.
Or thankful for what you have in life."
5883,2022-01-21 05:33:32+00:00,warikoo,"7. Read for 30 mins daily

Do not set targets for how many books to finish.
Do not feel the urge to show off the book you have just finished.
Read, for the joy of reading.
If you do not like the book, drop it and read another.

But read.
Everyday."
5884,2022-01-21 05:33:32+00:00,warikoo,"6. Brush twice

Our teeth are one of the most ignored parts of our body, until they make us realize they exist!
Plan for that to not happen.

Brush before you go to bed."
5885,2022-01-21 05:33:32+00:00,warikoo,"5. Meet someone new every week

Someone you have never spoken to.
Never met.
Never interacted with.

Ideally someone who is very different from you.

They will help you see the world differently from how you know it."
5886,2022-01-21 05:33:32+00:00,warikoo,"4. Smile at the mirror

Love yourself.
Wish yourself good morning.
Look into your eye and be grateful for the day.
Tell yourself, you are enough.
Everything is going to be ok.

If you do not acknowledge yourself, no one else will."
5887,2022-01-21 05:33:31+00:00,warikoo,"3. Do not try to remember anything

Write down stuff.
Put it on your calendar.
Stick notes.
Drop hints.

Your brain is to be used to comprehend and process.
Don't waste it on trying to remember to-do lists."
5888,2022-01-21 05:33:31+00:00,warikoo,"2. Send emails to yourself, in the future

Whatever is it that you are feeling right now, will disappear. 
Document this feeling.
And share it with your future self, when you think you will be ready to process it again.

Do not rely on memory."
5889,2022-01-21 05:33:31+00:00,warikoo,"1. Start your messages/emails by addressing them by their name

Don't just stop at hey or hi.
Go beyond.
Acknowledge the one thing that truly belongs to them.
Their name.

Even more so when you are replying.

Through this, they are likelier to remember you than others."

https://t.co/wMulQTHLWH"
6006,2022-01-14 07:43:18+00:00,warikoo,Luck always seems to be against the one who depends on it.
6007,2022-01-14 07:43:18+00:00,warikoo,"I would encourage you all to sit down today with yourself, reflect on your life and make a list of times where your ""lucked out"".

Go back further, to see if there was anything you did to sow the seeds for that luck.

Once found, that's what you could do now, more as a habit."
6008,2022-01-14 07:43:18+00:00,warikoo,"I see so many people scared of losing what they have, not because they value it immensely, instead because they do not know how to get it again.

Shitty jobs; shitty relationships; shitty investments. 

To me, that is submitting to luck as if it is a greater power."
6009,2022-01-14 07:43:17+00:00,warikoo,"We mostly think of luck as something beyond our control.
Which is a position of helplessness.
And no control.

I think of luck as something we set ourselves up for.
We still don't know what will work.
But we know that of all the things we have done, we just need one to work!"
6010,2022-01-14 07:43:17+00:00,warikoo,"As you might realize, this is luck at play. 
What starts as blind luck (finding my wife) changed character and ultimately moved to ""luck from my unique character"". 

@Naval summarized this well, in his definition of luck

6012,2022-01-14 07:43:16+00:00,warikoo,"The lockdown was announced.
And my only income stream (of corporate talks) went to zero.
I had 5 months of money left in my bank.
My friend suggested I moves these talks online.

If it wasn't for that chat, I might never have realized the power of online teaching."
6013,2022-01-14 07:43:16+00:00,warikoo,"I step down as the CEO of nearbuy.
And decide to take a 3 month break to figure what to do.
While focusing on the content game that I had started 5 years back.
Then COVID struck.

If it wasn't for COVID, I would not have gone full-time into my content play."
6014,2022-01-14 07:43:16+00:00,warikoo,"Paytm invests in a startup that quickly becomes No2 in the market.
We are trying to raise funds for nearbuy.
I see an opportunity and call VSS, ""I think we should merge""
He replies, ""Let's talk""

If it wasn't for ""Delhi Internet Mafia"" group, we may have never raised from Paytm."
6015,2022-01-14 07:43:15+00:00,warikoo,"Due to hard times at nearbuy, founders take a 50% paycut.
My expenses &gt;&gt;&gt; my income. I plunge into massive debt.
One day, I get an email from the Indonesian COO I had invested in, ""Keen to sell some of your equity?""

If it wasn't for that investment, I would have gone bankrupt."
6016,2022-01-14 07:43:15+00:00,warikoo,"Finding talent was super hard.
The only ways were either to pay a lot to the candidates, or to the media.
The team proposed we start creating content and speak directly.
And I be the spokesperson.

If it wasn't for talent crunch, I might have never started creating content."
6017,2022-01-14 07:43:15+00:00,warikoo,"To learn and share with my peers, I start a group called ""Delhi Internet Mafia""
And call all the Delhi based founders for a fun catchup.
Vijay Shekhar Sharma shows up for one of them (this is 2014)

If it wasn't for that group, I wouldn't have got to know VSS personally."
6018,2022-01-14 07:43:14+00:00,warikoo,"After 2 years, I get an expanded role for Groupon APAC.
One of the countries is Indonesia. The COO becomes a good friend.
After a year he leaves; I invest in his new startup.

If I didn't get the expanded role, I would have waited for the ""right time"" to start angel investing."
6019,2022-01-14 07:43:14+00:00,warikoo,"The venture starts, but doesn't work out.
The German company is also responsible for Groupon's international expansion.
So the founder asks if I would be interested in Groupon India.
I say yes!

If I hadn't applied to that original job, Groupon would not have happened to me."
6020,2022-01-14 07:43:14+00:00,warikoo,"After the 1st venture, I am looking for my next gig.
An email on ISB's alumni group: German Internet company wishes to enter India; looking for founders.
I apply, with no prior research.

If I'd done my homework, the reputation of that company would have stopped me from applying."
6021,2022-01-14 07:43:14+00:00,warikoo,"I randomly meet my batchmate from ISB.
He starts to share about a new venture he has started.
I ask him if I can help, along with my day job.
He graciously agrees.

If I hadn't met him that evening, I would have continued to wait for the ""right moment"", to become an entrepreneur!"
6022,2022-01-14 07:43:13+00:00,warikoo,"I dropped out of my PhD and was completely confused what to do.
Because of which I decided to go for an MBA from @ISBedu 
Which is when I realized what I was good at.

If I had continued with my PhD, I would have continued to live a life believing that was my only life."
6023,2022-01-14 07:43:13+00:00,warikoo,"I didn't make it to IIT for an MS.
Because of which I did just 1 more year of MS from Delhi Uni and left for the US for a PhD.
Which is where I realized, this wasn't my calling.

If I made it to IIT, I may have taken longer to realize what I didn't want to do."
6024,2022-01-14 07:43:13+00:00,warikoo,"I didn't make it to IIT after my Class 12th.
Because of which I went to Delhi University.
Which is where I met my future wife.

If I made it to IIT, I may have never met her!"

6143,2022-01-07 05:27:25+00:00,warikoo,"And often, just being aware of how the mind tricks us, is enough for our mind to stop tricking us.

Happy non-over-thinking :)"
6144,2022-01-07 05:27:25+00:00,warikoo,"Maybe being a science student helped me here. 
Maybe I was hard-wired this way.
Maybe I realized it along the way.

What I do know is that the mind is an animal willing to be tamed.
It wants to be tricked.
It wants to be compliant.
It wants to stop its wandering."
6145,2022-01-07 05:27:25+00:00,warikoo,"The reason I share this thread today, is because of all the problems that people reach out to me with, almost 70% of them involve over-thinking. 

They are convinced that it is a ""them"" problem.
And they are convinced that the possibility is equal to its probability."
6146,2022-01-07 05:27:25+00:00,warikoo,"That is it!
The way to ""solve"" overthinking.

Realize you are not alone in thinking of the bad more than the good.
And realize that when YOU are convinced that the probability of that bad thing is low, your mind will automatically be convinced."
6147,2022-01-07 05:27:24+00:00,warikoo,"Each time we step out, there is a possibility of getting hit by a bus. But we still step out fearlessly, right? How come?
Because we have told our brain, that the probability of that is low.
And how do we know that the probability is low?
Because we have witnessed that ourselves."
6148,2022-01-07 05:27:24+00:00,warikoo,"Just the possibility of an event, is enough to trigger overthinking.

What we need to add, to stop the overthinking, is probability.

Yes, its possible that I have an accident, but what is the probability?

And if you think about it - we ALL use this technique in our daily lives."
6149,2022-01-07 05:27:24+00:00,warikoo,"2. Our mind focusses on possibilities. Not probabilities.

This is an important one.
Our brain's job is to focus on the possibility.

Is it possible that you'll have an accident today: YES
Is it possible that you'll be kidnapped: YES
Is it possible that you'll be fired: YES"
6150,2022-01-07 05:27:24+00:00,warikoo,"We want to approach a stranger and our mind goes, ""Dude, why bother. Imagine if the stranger refuses and then people around you laugh at you?""

So we stop ourselves."
6151,2022-01-07 05:27:23+00:00,warikoo,"The dangers of being seen as a failure in society is still there.
So, our mind alerts us about them.

We have a question to ask in class and our mind goes, ""Dude, why bother. Imagine if the question turns out to be a stupid one and everyone laughs at you?"""
6152,2022-01-07 05:27:23+00:00,warikoo,"Over millions of years, this has become a habit of the human mind.
Alert us of the danger.
While the dangers of wild animals have reduced, others have taken their place.
The dangers of ""Sharma ji ke ladke ko dekho"" is still there. The dangers of being laughed at are still there."
6153,2022-01-07 05:27:23+00:00,warikoo,"Each time we ventured out, we could be attacked by a wild animal, or by members of another tribe, or even our tribe members who are jealous that you made it to IIT!

So, our brains were focused on ONLY ONE THING - alert us of the danger."
6154,2022-01-07 05:27:23+00:00,warikoo,"1. We are all hardwired to think more about the bad, than good.

This isn't something that is wrong with me. We ALL are hardwired this way.
Some time back, we all were cave men and women!
And at that point, the only thing that mattered was survival."

6158,2022-01-07 05:27:22+00:00,warikoo,"What happens is,
‚Äã""OMG dude, I can't stop this overthinking. They are going to reject me. I only have this interview. I already hate my job and if I don't get this one, then I do not know what I am going to do. And oh what if my boss finds out that I am interviewing!"
6159,2022-01-07 05:27:21+00:00,warikoo,"Imagine, your friend calls before an interview, ""OMG dude, they are going to love me, fall for my credentials, my experience, my pedigree and I am going to get this job. Money + this brand on my resume. SOMEBODY STOP THIS OVERTHINKING!""

No!
This doesn't happen."
6160,2022-01-07 05:27:21+00:00,warikoo,"Overthinking is a thing!
We all tend to overthink.
And strangely, it is almost always about the thing that will go bad.

It is hard-hitting, but easy to read.
Has no start or finish.

Numbers."
6319,2021-12-31 09:24:10+00:00,warikoo,"I do not care what people think of me. 
I can laugh at myself before people laugh at me.
I can admit my mistakes before people point them out.
I own up to my failures.

And if you can too, then NOBODY can touch you!
Least of all, a setback."

I am not the smartest person or the most hard working I know.

1. Acknowledge all those who have helped make this happen
@Razorpay @Zoom @owledmedia @AyushkWadhwa @ConvertKit @LearnWorlds @zapier Insane Marketers and so many more that I am missing"
6323,2021-12-31 09:24:09+00:00,warikoo,"Together with brand campaigns, affiliate income, corporate talks and B2B courses, the company hit revenue of Rs. 12.68Cr with a profit of Rs. 3.9Cr between Jan-Dec 2021

All under the hood."

1,14,972 students
generating Rs. 7.8Cr of sales (after refunds)
with a refund rate of 3.58%
and a course completion rate of 43% on average (with 81% going through 75% of the content)

All of this takes 3 hours of my time, per month"
6325,2021-12-31 09:24:08+00:00,warikoo,"2021 became the year of testing waters.

We had all components in place
1. A paid-promotion-engine that reached out to millions
2. A free-content-engine that generated trust
3. A universe of technology tools that helped us scale
4. A lean team that was incentivized correctly"
6326,2021-12-31 09:24:08+00:00,warikoo,"It also meant running a very different kind of business, from what I was used to.

1. No cofounders
2. No external funding
3. No ESOPs - instead profit sharing
4. No building everything internally - work with partners
5. No fast growth - be slow and deliberate"
6327,2021-12-31 09:24:08+00:00,warikoo,"In Nov 2020, we began to promote the course online. 

The key was to be super slow, scale profitably from Day 1 and run an ethical company.

That meant
1. 100% refund when asked - no questions asked
2. Do not lose money, ever!
3. Keep collecting feedback and improving the product"
6328,2021-12-31 09:24:08+00:00,warikoo,"By Oct 2020, I had earned Rs 36L, which after deductions and expenses gave me 12 months of run way.

6329,2021-12-31 09:24:07+00:00,warikoo,"By this time, our content game had also started to shape up

As of 26 October 2020
Instagram: 54,795
LinkedIn: 878,105
YouTube: 34,326
Twitter: 44,614

And I had the belief that this ""content -&gt; trust"" engine would work."
6330,2021-12-31 09:24:06+00:00,warikoo,"My content would never speak about my courses.
My content will always be free and would serve only one purpose. 
To add value.

Hopefully through that, generate trust.

So when people saw my ads and they most certainly do not know me, if they looked me up, they would see value."
6331,2021-12-31 09:24:06+00:00,warikoo,"In Oct 2020, I was introduced to Insane Marketers by @VaibhavSisinty, the OG of LinkedIn Marketing :)

I liked the team and felt they could be good partners in marketing these courses to a much wider audience.

Which I when I also took a conscious call."
6332,2021-12-31 09:24:06+00:00,warikoo,"While Ayush and team worked on the video for the next 2 months, I kept running these live classes, to build up a corpus. 

Did everything possible to reduce spending.
Even took the home loan moratorium announced by the government.

I was betting on myself!"
6333,2021-12-31 09:24:06+00:00,warikoo,"Found a great partner in Ayush @AyushkWadhwa 
A team of 5 locked ourselves up for a week, shooting for 8 hours every day, non-stop. 

We recorded 26 hours of content in that week. 
Which totaled 7 courses in all. https://t.co/O1da0KSysi"
6334,2021-12-31 09:24:04+00:00,warikoo,"By Aug 2020, I had 9 months of money in the bank, but the income was not stable and still unpredictable. 

My recordings had done well. And I now had to take some risk.

I decided to invest half of my savings into high-quality production of multiple courses."
6335,2021-12-31 09:24:04+00:00,warikoo,"I floated the recordings as a course, titled it ""Complete Guide to Starting Up"" and released it in the universe. 
Priced it at Rs. 1,499

Now, I was selling even when I wasn't working.
I was no longer renting my time!

@Naval would be so proud of me."
6336,2021-12-31 09:24:04+00:00,warikoo,"For the next 1 month, we had a lot of fun, learning together, answering questions, exploring ideas. 

But it was a drain on my time. 
And it was not scalable.

I had recorded all of these sessions. 
So I had an idea - would anyone be interested in recorded content?"
6337,2021-12-31 09:24:04+00:00,warikoo,"I then launched my first cohort-based-course: an 8-session course conducted every weekend, across a month. 

It was around the only thing I knew - how to startup.
And it was called ""The Future Founders Conference""

It was a priced event at Rs.999
400+ people signed up for it."
6338,2021-12-31 09:24:03+00:00,warikoo,"The next 3 months, I conducted 13 such sessions. 
All promoted on LinkedIn, because that's all I had.

4,700+ participants attended these sessions.
And as crazy as it sounds, I earned ~20L from these (still pay what you want!)

The peaks are when I posted about them on LinkedIn https://t.co/tVXOYNTVfB"
6339,2021-12-31 09:24:02+00:00,warikoo,"The next 90mins flew by.
I enjoyed myself a lot.

But did they?

I immediately sent an anonymous feedback form. 
To know where could I get better. 
How?

And people generously shared.
All of you helped me improve!
Those who were disappointed, I offered an immediate refund."
6340,2021-12-31 09:24:02+00:00,warikoo,"I was worried that they will not like what I had to share.

I remember feeling the same way I had felt as a kid, stepping onto the stage for the first time.
Legs trembling, heart beat racing, hands sweaty. 

The webinar started, I looked at the camera pinhole and went in my zone."
6341,2021-12-31 09:24:01+00:00,warikoo,"April 30, 2020:
I took a Pro account of @Zoom and was super nervous for my first online talk. 

So far, I had never charged the audience. I had charged the company. 
Now, I felt responsible for EVERY SINGLE PERSON on the webinar. 
They had paid to hear me talk about something."
6342,2021-12-31 09:24:01+00:00,warikoo,"The page is still live. And serves as a reminder to me, of how far along have I come.
https://t.co/d0SdJ2O2HB

Enthused by the reaction, I made an schedule for 13 such ""conferences"" for the months of May and June.

All ""pay what you want""."
6343,2021-12-31 09:24:01+00:00,warikoo,"I expected 50-100 people.
Who pays for webinars? Even if it is ""pay what you want"". 
They are mostly free!

In 3 days I had 900+ registrations.
50% of them paid Re.1
But the rest were generous.
The avg. came to Rs. 187

I had actually made MORE than what I would make usually."
6344,2021-12-31 09:24:01+00:00,warikoo,"April 22, 2020
I signed up for @Razorpay and created my first ever online talk, for April 30th

Because I did not even know if people will want to pay, I chose a ""pay whatever you want"" pricing.

Since LinkedIn was my only big platform then, that's where I shared it."
6345,2021-12-31 09:24:00+00:00,warikoo,"That triggered a reaction.
What she was saying is true.

I was such a ""in-real-life"" person that I did not know if I could replicate the same energy and enthusiasm online.
And will people pay for it?

But I had to find out."

I am speaking with a dear friend of mine, telling her how all corporate talks are over. 

People are scared of COVID and what it entails. Motivating and inspiring employees is the last thing on their mind. 

She listened and then said..."
6348,2021-12-31 09:23:59+00:00,warikoo,"I spoke to 100s of people - across the world - on new ideas, trends, opportunities. 

But there was one thing I did consistently - keep creating content. 
I had built this team of 6 awesome folks and we stayed true to our inputs.

Ship out content every single day!"

Did I want to start up again? Yes
Did I want to raise money for it? Ideally not
Did I want to work for a company? Last choice

I started exploring!"

2. Move to the mountains
3. Home school our kids

It sounds crazy. But I cannot over-emphasize how liberating it is to live life knowing money can never win over you!"
6351,2021-12-31 09:23:59+00:00,warikoo,"My worst case scenario was that I will not able to find an income stream in the next 3 months. Which meant we would have 2 months of cash left to take a decision.

I asked Ruchi what she thought we should do.
We both agreed on the solution."

6353,2021-12-31 09:23:58+00:00,warikoo,"That week was hard. 
It is one thing to be in this position when young.

It is another to find yourself such at 39, with 2 kids and a family to support. 
I could not let my decisions affect anyone beyond me!"

I recall watching the PM live and my heart sinking.
My only income stream had gone to zero, instantly!

At the age of 39, I was jobless, clueless, directionless and staring at 5 months of cash in the bank."
6355,2021-12-31 09:23:57+00:00,warikoo,"That paid the bills, while leaving me with a lot of time to figure what I wanted to do next.

One of which was my content game, that I had started in 2015/16.

In Jan 2020, I began looking for a team to help me with it.
In Mar 2020, a team of 6 was in place.

And then..."

1. I had invested all of my life savings into nearbuy (and a few other startups) 
2. I had drawn less than market salary all these years

While I was ""rich"" on paper, I did not have actual money."
6357,2021-12-31 09:23:57+00:00,warikoo,"I trusted my cofounders more than I trusted my own merit to lead the company forward.

So it was an easy decision to place my baby into their hands, and seek a new path for my life."

6871,2021-12-17 08:40:06+00:00,warikoo,"Every Friday, I write a thread on failure, life lessons, personal growth. You can follow me on @warikoo to get them on your feed.

My first book ""DO EPIC SHIT"" is out, where I share a lot of these lessons. You can pre-order it on Amazon
https://t.co/65jwVlzBI4"
6872,2021-12-17 08:40:06+00:00,warikoo,"That may be the best gift you can give yourself. 
And the best tribute to the years gone by."
6873,2021-12-17 08:40:06+00:00,warikoo,"Through this thread, I would invite you to write your own.
For yourself, not anyone else.

Take a moment to think of your childhood.
And through all the ups and downs, what shaped you up.
And how?"
6874,2021-12-17 08:40:06+00:00,warikoo,"I am an eternal optimist, shaped by the belief that in every obstacle there is a lesson, in every setback there is a takeaway, in every failure there is an opportunity to reflect.

While I have shared 7 lessons, I live with hundreds more.
I experience them everyday!"
6875,2021-12-17 08:40:06+00:00,warikoo,"I believe that is how life is.
Most lessons happen to us.
Should we care to learn.

The trick then is to live a life where you are setting yourself up for as many varied experiences as possible.
And to take the time to reflect as each day passes by."
6876,2021-12-17 08:40:05+00:00,warikoo,"Our childhood shapes us up in ways we do not fully understand until much later.

The lessons I shared today were not obvious to me until recently. But the day they were, I was thankful for them.

Because I didn't go out seeking these lessons.
They happened!"
6877,2021-12-17 08:40:05+00:00,warikoo,"Dad figured a place in Old Delhi that sells used overcoats.
Took the bus.
The old man was selling them for Rs.400/pc
We were overjoyed!
We had budgeted Rs.1000
Bought 2 overcoats.
Spent Rs.50 on Kulfi Faluda to celebrate :)

Lesson 7:
Most wonderful memories do not cost money."
6878,2021-12-17 08:40:05+00:00,warikoo,"I was to leave for the US in a month.
It had been an expensive affair - paying for the exams, visa, books.
We were completely out of money.

And I needed overcoats.
Michigan is a really cold place.
No one we knew had spare overcoats. 
Heck, no one even wore them in India :)"
6879,2021-12-17 08:40:05+00:00,warikoo,"Our sports instructor heard it.
""Do you have a sister?"", he asked.
""yes sir, I do""
""You just abused her!""

That was the last day I abused anyone.

Lesson 6:
Words have meaning.
They carry weight.
The ones you chose, travel a lot further than you think."
6880,2021-12-17 08:40:04+00:00,warikoo,"Studying in an all-boys school, I was surrounded by Hindi expletives. 
I started to use them as well.
Every sentence was preceded/followed by a whole host of bc/mc/chu words.

One day, unaware of my surroundings, I expressed anger at my friend by calling him ""behenc***"""
6881,2021-12-17 08:40:04+00:00,warikoo,"""I deserve to go. Not them.""

Then a friend said, ""there is a link, where you can fill in your details. It is reserved for science students.""
I filled it.
And got a pass!

Lesson 5:
You don't deserve anything in life.
Entitlement is a trap!"
6882,2021-12-17 08:40:04+00:00,warikoo,"Stephen Hawking was to visit India and give a talk in Delhi.
It was a BIG DEAL for me, as someone who loved his work.
The event was free.

However, since it was marketed massively, everyone wanted to come. And passes to the event were quickly over.

I was mad!"
6883,2021-12-17 08:40:03+00:00,warikoo,"I was terrified of the stage.
My first experience had been a disaster.

""You are going to be awesome. You have it in you. You just don't know it as yet."", she said.

Lesson 4:
Sometimes all it takes for you to believe in yourself, is for someone else to believe in you."
6884,2021-12-17 08:40:03+00:00,warikoo,"The biggest event in school was the Class12th farewell, organized by Class 11 students.
Close to the last day, one of the 2 kids selected as the host of the event fell sick.
And my class teacher insisted that I fill in for him."
6885,2021-12-17 08:40:03+00:00,warikoo,"Until we grew up and stopped playing.
We forgot about the game.
But our mind hadn't.

We knew how to ""come alive"" after dropping dead.

Lesson 3:
The games we played as kids, form our habits as adults.
But only if we realize this."
6886,2021-12-17 08:40:03+00:00,warikoo,"My sister and I every night used to play this fun game.
One would pretend to be dead, and the other person had to crack jokes to make them ""come alive"".
We called it ""aaaa main marr gaya"" (I am dead!)

The more we played, the better we got at making people ""come alive""."
6887,2021-12-17 08:40:02+00:00,warikoo,"I was angry that they didn't understand.

Until it dawned upon me.
They wanted the same things from my life, that I wanted from mine.
But their experiences had shaped up their reactions.

Lesson 2:
Everyone's life experiences shapes them up to see the world the way they do."
6888,2021-12-17 08:40:02+00:00,warikoo,"I was a PhD student in the US, on a 100% scholarship, top of my class, on a fast track to complete my research.

And I quit that, came back to India to restart my life all over again, at the age of 24.

My parents were devastated.
They had pinned their hopes on me."
6889,2021-12-17 08:40:02+00:00,warikoo,"Every smart person continued to ridicule dad for taking that call.
But my dad insisted that he would have still taken the call. There was no way to know!

He could have very well succeeded and heralded a hero.

Lesson 1:
Risk and failure is not absolute.
It is a state of mind."
6890,2021-12-17 08:40:01+00:00,warikoo,"Dad joined a company and in a year got an offer for double the salary and a car. 
This was 1990! And a big deal!

He quit his job, joined the new company, which shut down in a year.
He was without a job for 2 years.
Mom and dad did odd jobs to keep the home running."

7374,2021-12-03 06:23:38+00:00,warikoo,"My approach towards solving a problem is to fall in love with the problem as against the solution.
""What is it that I am trying to solve here?""

The deeper I understand the problem, the clearer the solution becomes.

This list is such an attempt."
7375,2021-12-03 06:23:38+00:00,warikoo,"Procrastination isn't always a bad word.
I know enough folks who deliver well under pressure.
Their choice to procrastinate stems from their self-awareness.

But not everyone is self-aware.
It baffles me how many of us do not understand the reasons behind their procrastination."
7376,2021-12-03 06:23:38+00:00,warikoo,"11. It is not authentically us

We procrastinate that thing the most which does not come naturally to us. That forces us to become someone else to complete it.

Here is the harsh truth
You will never be motivated to do anything that is not naturally you!"
7377,2021-12-03 06:23:37+00:00,warikoo,"10. The result is far, far away!

Goes back to pt 1 above.
When the result is far away, it becomes hard to understand how our work today will get us there.
We think we still have time!

Break down the journey into smaller milestones.
Pause at each milestone, celebrate, reflect."
7378,2021-12-03 06:23:37+00:00,warikoo,"9. We don't know what we are chasing

We want to get fit, but what does that even mean?
We want to feel fulfilled, but what does that even mean?

The more vague a goal we set, the likelier it is that we will procrastinate.

Set small, quantifiable, achievable goals."
7379,2021-12-03 06:23:37+00:00,warikoo,"8. We are low on energy

We do not feel like doing it.
We get to it and feel drained.
""I will pick it up tomorrow, when I am fresh.""

How we manage our time, is an outcome of how we manage our energy.
Pick up the hardest things to do, when high on energy.

A ping.

And we drop our work.

A thought.
We drop our work.

Stop all notifications.
Write down all thoughts that distract you.
Close all other windows.
And follow the Pomodoro technique

7381,2021-12-03 06:23:36+00:00,warikoo,"6. We want things to be perfect

We are worried our work will be sub-optimal, setting us up for judgement.
Plus, the visualization of what is needed for perfection, overwhelms us.

Accuracy &gt;&gt; Perfection.
Nothing is ever perfect. 
But if it accurate, it is well on its way."
7382,2021-12-03 06:23:36+00:00,warikoo,"5. We overthink about all the bad things that can happen

Our mind is trained to warn us of danger.
And hence, it focuses on the bad more than the good.

The trick is to focus on probabilities. And not possibilities.
Just because something is possible, doesn't make it probable."
7383,2021-12-03 06:23:36+00:00,warikoo,"4. We fear failure

We are paralyzed, because we are scared we might fail.
What if this doesn't work?
So, we don't even start!

I take the smallest first step that I can, which has zero chance of failure.
And that sense of progress, tricks my mind.
It stops feeling scared."
7384,2021-12-03 06:23:35+00:00,warikoo,"3. ""I don't have time""

You have a lot to do.
So it becomes easy to procrastinate what, in your head, isn't urgent.

But it could be important.
Classify your tasks into urgent and important. 

The most important things in life, will rarely be urgent."
7385,2021-12-03 06:23:35+00:00,warikoo,"2. We have a LOT of options

We just don't know which one to pick. 

FOMO takes over. 
What if we pick the wrong one?

Creativity takes over.
The ideas just keep coming.

Sit with each option and imagine the future consequences. Eliminate them, basis what you don't like."
7386,2021-12-03 06:23:35+00:00,warikoo,"However, it can play havoc if our estimate is wrong, or it causes anxiety last minute.

Break down the task into smaller measurable tasks.
Add up the times it will take.
Add some buffer.
The sum is the estimated time you will need.

Now compare it with the time you actually have."

7515,2021-11-26 06:15:59+00:00,warikoo,"Productivity is never an accident.
It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning and focused effort.

- Paul Meyer"
7516,2021-11-26 06:15:59+00:00,warikoo,"Even if you were to pick 5 of these hacks and create a 30-day challenge to follow them, I guarantee you results that will surprise you!"
7517,2021-11-26 06:15:58+00:00,warikoo,"These hacks are simple.
What's harder is the intent.

My experience tells me that forming habits to be productive and feel productive have massive compounding effects.

The best time to start was in your teens.
The next best time is today!"
7518,2021-11-26 06:15:58+00:00,warikoo,"Productivity is another word for progress.
If we sense progress, we feel productive.

So you want to design your life in a way that you are constantly measuring progress, and feeling a sense of progress.

The more you do, the more productive you will become."
7519,2021-11-26 06:15:58+00:00,warikoo,"17. Minimize decisions

Minimize the decisions you have to take.
Which starts with, being quick to take decisions too.

99% of the decisions we take are reversible.
Don't spend time trying to make the right one.
Just make one!

Spend time on the few decisions that truly matter."
7520,2021-11-26 06:15:58+00:00,warikoo,"16. Write down your distracting thoughts

Keep a notepad handy.
As soon as you are distracted, write it down.

Writing tells your brain that it is important.
The minute the brain identifies it as important, it relieves itself.
Allowing you to go back to what you were doing."
7521,2021-11-26 06:15:57+00:00,warikoo,"15. Listen to songs without lyrics

Songs with lyrics get us to hum along.
Taking our attention away.

Instead, play music known to help with mindfulness.
Listen to your favorite songs, during your distraction time."
7522,2021-11-26 06:15:57+00:00,warikoo,"14. Do not try to remember anything

This is my magic hack!
I write everything down.
And have a way of retrieving that, when required.

Not spending your energy in remembering things, frees you up to do things!"
7523,2021-11-26 06:15:57+00:00,warikoo,"13. Schedule distraction time

Do not try to shut down distraction time.
Instead, schedule it.

You will love forward to it.
And you will be more disciplined about it."
7524,2021-11-26 06:15:57+00:00,warikoo,"12. Reply to messages/emails when people are less likely to respond

The biggest time suck is real-time communication. 
It requires you to be attentive, respond and take decisions.
It consumes energy.

If not needed, then avoid it."
7525,2021-11-26 06:15:56+00:00,warikoo,"11. Create a to-do list and check things off

Psychologically, we get a sense of progress and achievement when we check things off.
Create a small to-do list everyday, on a piece of paper (not your phone/PC)
And check them off, as you finish them."
7526,2021-11-26 06:15:56+00:00,warikoo,"10. Pick the hardest things when high on energy

Find out when is your energy at its peak. 
Could be early morning, mid-day or late into the night.

Reserve the hardest things for that time.
That is when you will find the flow to get it done."
7527,2021-11-26 06:15:56+00:00,warikoo,"9. The 2-min rule

If something takes less than 2-mins to get done, then get it done right away.

Postponing them only adds to the cognitive load our mind had to bear with.
We think we still have a LOT to do.
Feeling burdened and overwhelmed."
7528,2021-11-26 06:15:56+00:00,warikoo,"8. Make your frequent apps hard to find

Do not place them on the home screen.
Put them in some random folder, called something random.

In addition to time limits, the visual hurdle to get to your app will make you spend a LOT less time."
7529,2021-11-26 06:15:55+00:00,warikoo,"7. Put all tasks on your calendar

Build the habit of using a calendar.
And then put EVERYTHING on the calendar.

Not just meetings and work tasks.
Birthdays.
Bills to be paid.
Reminders.
Family events.
Daily routine.

It will add structure to what might look like a random day!"
7530,2021-11-26 06:15:55+00:00,warikoo,"6. Send emails to yourself in the future

You can schedule emails for a later time. 
Use those to be reminded of things you remember right now, but cannot pick up right now.

Be as detailed as possible. 
Attach images, voice notes, links etc.

https://t.co/VMJ5IUYj8h"
7531,2021-11-26 06:15:55+00:00,warikoo,"5. Create a self-WhatsApp group

Create a WA group with someone.
Delete that person.
Pin that group to the top.

Now you have a WA group with just yourself.
Use it to record your pics, voice notes, typed notes.
Basically anything!

Super hack for quick recording and retrieval."
7532,2021-11-26 06:15:54+00:00,warikoo,"4. Set app usage limits

Use your phone to set time limits on the app you tend to waste time on.

Use a password to unlock and ask someone in your family to set that password (you shouldn't know it!)

Similarly, use website blockers."
7533,2021-11-26 06:15:54+00:00,warikoo,"3. Set specific times to check your emails

If you check your emails as and when they arrive, you will be sucked into them! 

Schedule your emails to hit your inbox only at scheduled times (I do it 4 times a day). 
Then use Pomodoro to go through them all in one go."
7534,2021-11-26 06:15:54+00:00,warikoo,"2. Pomodoro Technique

A time management technique that's proven to maximize productivity and attention.

Break your day into 25min chunks followed by a 5min break (this 30min unit is called Pomodoro).
After about 4 pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-20mins.

7535,2021-11-26 06:15:52+00:00,warikoo,"1. Record your thoughts through an audio recorder

Audio captures not just the thoughts but also our emotions at that moment.
Which is super helpful, when we hear it again in the future. 

Bonus: Start the voice note with ""I am recording this while I was doing...""
Context helps."

Create an opportunity engine.

7643,2021-11-19 06:49:38+00:00,warikoo,"I have often wondered, how do people get opportunities?
Are they lucky?
Is it because they work hard?
Is it because they are at the right place at the right time?
Is it because they know somebody?
What is it?"

7645,2021-11-19 06:49:38+00:00,warikoo,"10. Hear the signs

The world is full of opportunities now. If you are continue to be focused on the path you are on, you might miss what is on your side.
An alternate path.
A new change.
A deviation.

Give yourself the freedom to consider that path."
7646,2021-11-19 06:49:38+00:00,warikoo,"9. Be kind, generous and helpful

The surest way to ensure opportunities keep knocking on your door, is to be willing to truly help people.
Expecting nothing in return."

Do not hesitate to take decisions.
Especially when faced with rare or typical choices to make.

Even if they do not work out, you can always come back to where you started from."
7649,2021-11-19 06:49:37+00:00,warikoo,"7. Share your work. Consistently.

Nothing attracts opportunities than consistent work from your end.
You could be creating, curating, producing - doesn't matter.

I feel @SahilBloom is such a great example of this. 
Consistently shipping out value, purely driven by curiosity."
7650,2021-11-19 06:49:36+00:00,warikoo,"6. Create or join online communities

With a remote-friendly world, the best opportunities are in communities where people hang out, across experiences and geographies.

If you like someone's work (book, post, video, podcast) drop them a note thanking them for it. 

And while at it, send a thoughtful note.
Not just a simple thanks.
Be detailed and deliberate about how they helped you.
It will be retained."
7653,2021-11-19 06:49:35+00:00,warikoo,"4. Engage with people's content meaningfully

If you follow someone's content, don't just consume. 
Engage.

Writing to those who do not know you, is a life skill. Most working professionals still use email as the dominant form of communication. 

You do not know which one of them will be replied to, but writing consistently ensures opportunities coming in steady."
7658,2021-11-19 06:49:34+00:00,warikoo,"How?
a) Pick up something that hasn't been working for you - could be anything - interviews, exams, dating etc.
b) Identify someone whose advice you would NEVER consider, because you think they do not understand you or your world.
c) Ask them how would they approach it?"
7659,2021-11-19 06:49:34+00:00,warikoo,"1. Spend time with people different from you

A life comprising 900+ months! 

Would you spend 5% of your life, trying to make the remaining 95% better?"
7906,2021-11-05 05:57:15+00:00,warikoo,"That person is me today!

I share these 90-day challenges, not as an expert, instead as someone who has tried each one of them and has witnessed the powerful outcomes."

you would laugh at that person!"
7908,2021-11-05 05:57:15+00:00,warikoo,"Don't pick all of them in one go.
Key is to train your mind, be patient with it, be calm with it and keep challenging it."
7909,2021-11-05 05:57:14+00:00,warikoo,"Isn't it fascinating that just 90-day can change your life, if you commit to it.

Just 3-months to a whole new mindset?

That is all it takes."
7910,2021-11-05 05:57:14+00:00,warikoo,"For 90-days, pick a task you would otherwise procrastinate, and break it down into smaller tasks.
Really small tasks.
And then estimate the time it would take you to accomplish that small task.

Add up the individual times.
You will have your answer."
7911,2021-11-05 05:57:14+00:00,warikoo,"If I ask you to clap every second, you will do a near perfect job.
If I ask you to clap every 5 seconds, you will begin to falter.
If I ask you to class every 17 seconds, you will be out of sync instantly!

7912,2021-11-05 05:57:14+00:00,warikoo,"10. Procrastination

Here is the simple reason we procrastinate.
We think we still have time!

That's it.

So the way to deal with procrastination, to is realize that we do not in fact have time."
7913,2021-11-05 05:57:13+00:00,warikoo,"At the end of this, you would have trained your mind and thus tricked it, to not over power you with its possibilities.

Because you now know the probabilities too."
7914,2021-11-05 05:57:13+00:00,warikoo,"Each time we step out, there is a possibility of getting hit by a bus. But we still step out fearlessly, right? How come?
Because we have told our brain, that the probability of that is low.

For 90-days, assign probabilities to EVERY possibility your mind comes up with."
7915,2021-11-05 05:57:13+00:00,warikoo,"9. Over-thinking

Our mind is our best friend, for it has the power to imagine.
And our worst enemy, because it is trained to imagine the worst more than anything else.

Our mind focusses on possibilities. 
Not probabilities."
7916,2021-11-05 05:57:12+00:00,warikoo,"By the 90th day, you are waking up 1.5hrs earlier than you were.

Ofcourse, this will only happen if your body doesn't feel sleep deprived.
So ideally, you should have slept on time as well. 

https://t.co/AqCXNKxclD"
7917,2021-11-05 05:57:12+00:00,warikoo,"Whatever time you get up today, set the alarm for 10 mins earlier.
So 8am becomes 750am
Get up at 750am. 
No snoozing!
Do that for 10 straight days.

Your body won't even notice the difference.

Again 10 mins earlier.
10 days.
10 mins earlier.
10 days."
7918,2021-11-05 05:57:12+00:00,warikoo,"8. Waking up on time

If you get up at 8am today and wish to get up at 6am, it won't happen by just setting up an alarm.
You might win 2-3 days, maybe even a week.
Post which, your body will crave to go back to ""normal""

The key is to trick the body to waking up early."
7919,2021-11-05 05:57:12+00:00,warikoo,"And for each of those options, ask yourself 2 questions
1. What's the worst thing that can happen?
2. What's the best thing that can happen?

This simple exercise for 90-days, will change the way you look at decisions."
7920,2021-11-05 05:57:11+00:00,warikoo,"For 90-day, when faced with any decision, ask yourself, ""What would most people in my situation do?""

And then for sometime, ignore that option.
As if it doesn't exist.
And force yourself to consider other alternatives.
As crazy as they sound."
7921,2021-11-05 05:57:11+00:00,warikoo,"7. Resisting the obvious

If we do what everyone does, we will end up more or less where everyone else does.

To have a shot at changing our orbit, we have to look beyond the obvious.
And consider it, if not follow it. 

But we are not trained to think beyond the obvious."
7922,2021-11-05 05:57:11+00:00,warikoo,"Then, reflect upon 3 things
1. How did I feel?
2. Why did I feel what I felt?
3. What could I have done, to be accepted instead of rejected?

Attempt the same task again, with this reflection.

In 90-days, you would have a very different, meaningful relationship with rejection."
7923,2021-11-05 05:57:11+00:00,warikoo,"Everyday, for 90-days, pick up a small, immaterial harmless task where we have a high chance of getting rejected.

Asking a stranger for a favor
Sending a cold email
Saying hi to a random person
Asking parents for permission
Asking manager for a new assignment"
7924,2021-11-05 05:57:10+00:00,warikoo,"6. Getting rejected

We all hate rejection.
We fear it, in fact.
We fear it so much, that we do not even start anything, for the fear of being rejected.

Rejection though, is like a muscle.
That can be built.
For us to get ""comfortable"" with it."
7925,2021-11-05 05:57:10+00:00,warikoo,"Just observe them, as if you were observing cars passing by on the road.
You are not attached to any car.
You at best observe the color, the driver, admire the make model.
And then its gone.
And you move to the next car.

90-days
You will be changed!"
7926,2021-11-05 05:57:10+00:00,warikoo,"5. Meditation

Put on a nature sound (beach, rain, birds etc)
Sit straight (on the floor, or a chair)
Close your eyes
And just observe your thoughts
For 10 mins

Don't try to stop any thought
Don't try to record any thought
Don't try to go deep into any thought"
7927,2021-11-05 05:57:10+00:00,warikoo,"If the book doesn't interest you, drop it and pick another one.

But read everyday for 10 mins.

https://t.co/SnmBbsGh8I"
7928,2021-11-05 05:57:09+00:00,warikoo,"4. Reading

Pick up a book you wish to read, not a book that you think you should read.

And read for 10 minutes everyday, for 90-days.

Do not share the name of the book with anyone or the fact that you are reading it.
Do it for yourself."
7929,2021-11-05 05:57:09+00:00,warikoo,"3. Sugar craving

Whenever you feel like having sugar, drink a glass of water and then have sugar-free chewing gum.

Water fills your stomach.
Gum satiates your sugar craving.
Because you are chewing it, you can't have anything else.

90days and you won't crave for sugar anymore."
7930,2021-11-05 05:57:09+00:00,warikoo,"2. Confident speaking

We get conscious when it comes to public speaking.
Even if we are confident of the content.

Record a video of yours for 90-days, on ANY topic.

Do not share it with anyone.
Review it, identify improvements and correct them the next day."
7931,2021-11-05 05:57:09+00:00,warikoo,"Writing is the slowest form of expression.
When we write, we are not just thinking about what we wish to communicate, we are also selecting the most important thought from all other thoughts.

Write everyday for 90-days.
And always conclude with a ""This tells me that ________"""
7932,2021-11-05 05:57:08+00:00,warikoo,"1: Structured thinking

Our mind is buzzing with thoughts.
But when we start speaking, we fail to structure them.

What is needed, is a way to pace our thoughts.

That is where writing helps."

8006,2021-10-29 06:34:01+00:00,warikoo,"I questioned if it made me happy and if I was good at it.
I questioned if it was what the world needed.
And then found how I could make a living from it.

We know of this as ""ikigai""
I knew of it as the way I lived my life and will continue to."
8007,2021-10-29 06:34:01+00:00,warikoo,"All through my life, I have found myself exploring different paths at different points of times.

At first - 
becoming a scientist
then a consultant
then an entrepreneur
today a teacher

All through these different phases, I never lied to myself."
8008,2021-10-29 06:34:00+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 11:
Your passion starts with what makes you happy and what you are good at.

It is possible that what you are good at, doesn't make you happy.
Or what makes you happy isn't something you are good at. 

Their intersection is the start of your passion journey."
8009,2021-10-29 06:34:00+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 10:
Your passion will make you money, once you ask ""how does my passion help others?""

Your passion helps you.
It serves you.

For it to make money though, it has to serve others.
Whatever your passion, ""how does it help others"" will always have an answer.
Find that answer."
8010,2021-10-29 06:33:59+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 9:
Your passions will change

We change as people, and so will our passions.
It is then, the growth mindset that allows us to keep evolving our passions.

Holding on to a passion that no longer serves as one, is you holding on to a potential mistake."
8011,2021-10-29 06:33:59+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 8:
Our failures direct us towards our passions a lot more than success

Whenever we fail, we seek solace and inspiration.
It is during such moments that our potential passions emerge.
What is it that we gravitate towards.
Where we can be we.
And not have to pretend."
8012,2021-10-29 06:33:58+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 7:
Time is the biggest reason people don't discover their passion

Your passion will take several years to turn into your career.
But the problem is, we want everything today.

We have forgotten the art of pursuing something with no goal. Instead because we want to."
8013,2021-10-29 06:33:58+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 6:
You will never be passionate about something that is not authentically you.

The starting point of your passion, is who do you have to become to live that passion out?
If the answer is ""someone you are not"", then that is not a passion.

It is simply a desire"
8014,2021-10-29 06:33:57+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 5:
Passions don't come in templates.

Stop looking for standard answers to what your passion could be.

Your context, your experiences, your habits, your idiosyncrasies - all lend itself to a passion that is uniquely you.

Don't make someone else's passion yours."
8015,2021-10-29 06:33:57+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 4:
""Quit your job to follow your passion"" is poor advice

Financial stability is a thing.
When we sacrifice that, to follow our passion, we put the pressure of making money on our passion, from day 1.

Our passion then becomes our necessity!
And ultimately dies."
8016,2021-10-29 06:33:57+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 3:
Passion isn't about money. It is about how you feel.

We are led to believe that if you follow your passion, you will make a lot of money, which will gives you a lot of happiness.

The most passionate people I know are simply content.
At peace with who they are."
8017,2021-10-29 06:33:56+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 2:
Very few find their passion early in life. Most find it much later, if at all.

The world convinces us that we should ""pick"" a passion as early as possible and then settle.

I think all of 20s should go towards discovering your passion.
Don't settle. Explore."
8018,2021-10-29 06:33:56+00:00,warikoo,"Truth 1:
You don't find your passion. You grow your passion.

Most of us feel dumb, because we can't seem to ""find"" our passion.

The key is to pursue multiple interests, the journey of which will help us discover the one thing that completes us."

You do your best to build your own truths."

School and college are one of the worst products for just an ""education"".

I participated in competitions where I had no hope of winning, stood on stage trembling, wrote cold emails, did internships.
I faced my fears."

Until my class teaches in 11th changed my life.
She encouraged me, supported me, trusted me - and that made me trust myself.

I dabbled in so many different activities that allowed me to understand myself."

8544,2021-09-24 06:33:32+00:00,warikoo,"11. If you aren‚Äôt happy, you will never do your best work!

This was true for me then. And is true for me now.
My state mentally, physically, emotionally, drove my inputs and my contribution.

Thus, working in toxic places didn‚Äôt work for me.
I reckon wouldn‚Äôt work for anyone."
8545,2021-09-24 06:33:32+00:00,warikoo,"10. Speed is not equal to intelligence

I used to think if I do my work faster, I am smarter.
Until my manager told me that I am paid for doing my work right, not doing my work fast!"
8546,2021-09-24 06:33:31+00:00,warikoo,"9. Don‚Äôt be in a hurry to create impact. Be in a hurry to learn.

Early on, focus on your learning curve.
No one expects you to create impact.
Don‚Äôt expect yourself to create one too.

Learn.
Everyday."
8547,2021-09-24 06:33:31+00:00,warikoo,"8. ‚ÄúGood people will pay a far higher price for being good, than bad people will pay for being bad‚Äù

If you are good, more work will come to you.
More responsibilities will be put on you.
More expectations will be from you.

That is the price I was willing to pay."
8548,2021-09-24 06:33:30+00:00,warikoo,"7. Don‚Äôt complain. 

Every break during the work day was a reason for people to complain. 
About random shit.
The internet, the office food, the AC, their manager, their salary.

It never fixed anything. 
Complaining never does!"
8549,2021-09-24 06:33:30+00:00,warikoo,"6. Spend time with different people

Within a week of joining ISB, people formed groups.
Engineers with engineers. Lawyers with lawyers. Delhi with Delhi.

I instead gained the most spending time with people who were nothing like me.
Don‚Äôt amplify your beliefs. Add to them."
8550,2021-09-24 06:33:29+00:00,warikoo,"5. Don‚Äôt get comfortable

Everything around us is designed for our comfort.
So it was easy to believe that life‚Äôs purpose is to make life comfortable. 

But surprisingly people who inspired me were not making comfortable choices!
They challenged themselves everyday."
8551,2021-09-24 06:33:28+00:00,warikoo,"4. Resist the obvious

When faced with choices to make, I would ask ‚ÄúWhat would most people not do, but is possible?‚Äù
Because the obvious choices would lead to the average outcomes.

The non-obvious paths could potentially lead to extraordinary outcomes."
8552,2021-09-24 06:33:28+00:00,warikoo,"3. Managing people is the eventual task

As much as I was paid early on to do tasks, it was evident that rising up the ladder would not be about doing tasks, instead would be about getting these tasks done through and with people."
8553,2021-09-24 06:33:27+00:00,warikoo,"2. Curiosity drives learning

Be curious.
I ask questions.
I try to figure out why things happen the way they do.
I spent time getting to know my customers, my colleagues.

Approach things with child like curiosity. 
If you do, you will have a clearer reason for why you do things"
8554,2021-09-24 06:33:27+00:00,warikoo,"1. ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt trust you, it does not matter how smart you are.‚Äù

The words of my first manager have stayed me forever. 

Trust is everything.
Once I was able to generate trust for myself in others, I began to see opportunities that weren‚Äôt visible until now."

Dad was working with a pharma company. While at it, he got an offer with twice the salary and a car. He took it.
That company shut down in 6 months. He was jobless for 18 months.

His original company was Ranbaxy, where if he had stayed, life would've been very different"
9323,2021-07-30 06:33:26+00:00,warikoo,"I learnt that the best thing a parent can give their kids, isn't money or knowledge or manners or shelter or even love.

It is encouragement."
9324,2021-07-30 06:33:25+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 4
During my summer holidays, I used to read the same books and comics over and over again, because that is all we got.

Ma one day, frustrated by the scene, pleaded to her cousin to lend me all her childhood books. 

At 14 I got a collection of 14 Enid Blyton books :)"
9325,2021-07-30 06:33:25+00:00,warikoo,"I think dad cried that day.
I could not tell. 
And I have never asked.

I learnt that money by itself is emotionless.
But it makes you feel and do things that are almost always driven by emotions.
Money generates emotions.

Emotions that you may like or not.
But can't ignore."
9326,2021-07-30 06:33:24+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 3
At the peak of our family financial crisis, we received news that the govt would pay a compensation for dad's house in Kashmir, which was destroyed by now.

That money saved us.
Dad would never have the home he grew up in.
But he had miraculously saved his family now."
9327,2021-07-30 06:33:24+00:00,warikoo,"I learnt that as a kid, one of the hardest things to do is to not laugh.
And then somehow, we grow up.
And get better at not laughing!

The hardest thing then becomes, to laugh."
9328,2021-07-30 06:33:23+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 2
My sis and I used to play a game every night before going to bed.
""Aaaa main mar gaya"" (""I just died"")

One had to pretend to be dead.
The other had to crack jokes to awaken the dea.
If the dead smirked/smiled/laughed, they lost!"
9329,2021-07-30 06:33:23+00:00,warikoo,"I learnt that the difference between bankruptcy and survival is often not that big.

Difference between chaos and stability is often not that big."
9330,2021-07-30 06:33:22+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 1
Dad had just lost his job. 
We were down to our last few thousands.
He went to the bank to withdraw 10K, and on his way back someone robbed him of it.

We plunged into chaos.
Financial debt.
Personal favors.
Collectors at our doorstep.

That 10K made all the difference"

9507,2021-07-16 07:33:10+00:00,warikoo,"7. But, you can make happy money from it, if you want to

There are 2 ways of making money from newsletters

1. Sponsorships - which will only kick in at scale (50K+ subs) or if you have built something really niche. 
This is hard to pull off"
9508,2021-07-16 07:33:09+00:00,warikoo,"6. It is expensive

Working with a good email service provider can be expensive. 
I use @ConvertKit and spend $700+ pm - which is almost $1/subscriber.

But I love the product, their focus on deliverability and their minimalist approach towards newsletters."
9509,2021-07-16 07:33:08+00:00,warikoo,"5. Mix long form with short form

A lot of us have stopped or reduced reading.
So to build a large audience, you will have to mix long and short form content.

Have a consistent structure. 
So people know what to expect.
And they self select their preferred sections."

9511,2021-07-16 07:33:08+00:00,warikoo,"4. Early on, reply to almost everyone

For 2 reasons
1. It tells the email service provider that this is a conversational email and not a transactional one

2. It helps you understand your audience even better."

- Asking questions works (Do you hate Mondays?)
- Provocative statements work (You let me down). Be careful though
- Do not be boring (Newsletter #234) 
- Below 60 characters
- Ask yourself ""Would I open a cold email with this subject line?"""
9513,2021-07-16 07:33:07+00:00,warikoo,"Delivery:
- Work with email service providers that specialize in content emails as against transaction emails.
- Keep HTML to minimum
- Do not use spam words anywhere (https://t.co/eDvanppw0Z)
- Read up about DKIM and SPIF: it is technical but necessary for your email address"
9514,2021-07-16 07:33:06+00:00,warikoo,"3. Open rate is everything

When you send a newsletter, no one can read what's inside.
They first have to see it (in their inbox)
And then be enticed by the subject line, to open it.

Like it or not, you will have to spend time on these 2 elements - delivery and subject lines."
9515,2021-07-16 07:33:06+00:00,warikoo,"Consistency is the biggest thing when it comes to creating content.

Algorithms respect consistency.
People respect consistency.

9516,2021-07-16 07:33:05+00:00,warikoo,"2. If you don't like writing, you will struggle initially

At the core of it, a newsletter is a writing pad.
You pick your own thoughts, or someone else's and give it structure through your words.

If that comes naturally to you, you will find it easy to be consistent."
9517,2021-07-16 07:33:05+00:00,warikoo,"1. Find your topic and then find who likes that topic. Not the other way around.

Don't start a newsletter for anyone else.
Start it for yourself.
Because you want to write.
Because you want to share.
Because you have something to share.

The audience will self-select themselves."

9566,2021-07-09 08:24:51+00:00,warikoo,"The 20s is a wonderful decade.

It is the time to explore - yourself, the world, your relationship with it.
In my experience, what you end up doing this decade can undo a bad past and setup a great future.

Use this decade to not set goals.
But set habits!"
9567,2021-07-09 08:24:50+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 20:
Remove toxic relationships

It is in our 20s that we form the most meaningful relationships.
But it is also the decade where we persist with old ones that we shouldn't.

Knowing how to walk away from such relationships, is key to knowing how to respect yourself."
9568,2021-07-09 08:24:50+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 19:
Eat right

This decade is when we abuse our body the most. And we think nothing will happen.

And nothing will happen - until much later, by which time it will be late!

Your eating habits in your 20s is the biggest indicator of your long term planning."
9569,2021-07-09 08:24:49+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 18:
Trust first

In a trust deficient world, learn how to trust people first, than wait for them to win your trust.

Believe that most people are not bad.
And that the 5% that aren't don't define the world!"
9570,2021-07-09 08:24:49+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 17:
Know how to learn

The world is rapidly changing.
What you know today, may not even exist tomorrow.

The only thing then, that can set you up for life, is if you know how to become a student, when you have to!

Know what it is to learn anything, by yourself!"
9571,2021-07-09 08:24:48+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 16:
Do one thing every week that scares you

We will always be surrounded by danger, by unexpected events, by difficult circumstances.

The only thing we can do, it to be comfortable with feeling scared.
And facing the fear.

This habit does precisely that!"
9572,2021-07-09 08:24:48+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 15:
Patience

I grew up in the 80/90s when we had to stand in line to get milk, a phone connection, buy a ticket.

You today are devoid of this experience.
So force yourself into situations where you have to wait.

Because all good things in life, take time!"
9573,2021-07-09 08:24:47+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 14:
Read books

There are 2 ways to learn from mistakes.
One is to make them, two is to read about mistakes other's made.

Read what you love the most - be it comics, magazines, articles.
Fall in love with reading.
The books will automatically happen."
9574,2021-07-09 08:24:46+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 12:
Work out everyday

Be it gym, running, swimming, playing, climbing - give your body the respect it deserves.

I abused my body for 33 years, before getting a second life.
But it took me a disease to realize it.

You don't want to go through the same."
9575,2021-07-09 08:24:46+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 11:
Send a cold email every week

Send an email to someone who doesn't know you.
It doesn't need to be with an agenda.
It could be simply an appreciation, an acknowledgement.

Doing so every week, you will set up luck to work for you.
How? You don't know!
But it will work!"
9576,2021-07-09 08:24:45+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 10:
Live below your means

No one expects you to rich in your 20s.
So don't pretend to be.

Don't buy a house in your 20s.
Don't take loans in your 20s.
Don't have money in your bank beyond an emergency fund.
Invest.
Your money. In yourself."
9577,2021-07-09 08:24:45+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 9:
Don't be the commentator

It is very easy to comment from the outside.
It is intensely hard to be the one in the arena, fighting it out.

Appreciate the courage.
Savor the experience.
Encourage yourself to be in the arena.

But don't be the commentator."
9578,2021-07-09 08:24:44+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 8:
Don't complain

We get good at whatever it is that we do everyday.
And that includes complaining.

Don't complain.
You can be angry, sad, bitter or dejected.
And that's normal. 
That's human.

But don't complain!"
9579,2021-07-09 08:24:44+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 7:
Resist the obvious

If you do what everyone else does, you will end up where everyone else will.

For every situation, think of what the majority crowd will do and then think of things beyond that.
Make it into a game.

Soon, it will become the way you think."
9580,2021-07-09 08:24:43+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 6:
Say thank you

Don't ever get tired of saying thank you. 
Say it for the smallest things.
Say it to everyone.

And when you say it, be genuinely thankful.

That feeling of gratitude will help you, for your entire life."
9581,2021-07-09 08:24:43+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 5:
Write everyday

Not type.
Write.
With a pen or pencil. On paper.

When we write, we slow down our thoughts. 
We structure our thoughts. 
We train our mind to think coherently. 
To reflect upon what we are thinking."
9582,2021-07-09 08:24:42+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 4:
Call people by their names

Few things makes a person feel included, than hearing their name in a conversation.
Remember, consciously, to include their names, as you speak to them.

You will earn their respect, their attention and their trust."
9583,2021-07-09 08:24:42+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 3:
Take the first 30 mins of your morning, for yourself

Don't start it with your phone.
Or with a person.
Or with a book.
Or the toilet.

Just you, your thoughts, some lasting memory of your dreams.

You will appreciate the power of slowing down."
9584,2021-07-09 08:24:41+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 2:
Make your bed
Starts your day with a small accomplishment.

Growing up, the 4 of us used to sleep together in the drawing room, since it had a cooler.

It was my job to make everyone's bed.
It was the last thing I did every night and the first every morning.
Still do it."
9585,2021-07-09 08:24:40+00:00,warikoo,"Habit 1: 
Smile at the mirror

20s is the decade of self doubt. Where we feel inadequate, incomplete, lost.

The simple habit of smiling at the mirror, makes me drop my emotions in that moment. 

And acknowledge me, for who I am."

9780,2021-06-18 05:36:53+00:00,warikoo,"And then we grow up to form goals and targets.
The more short term they are, the better we feel hitting them.

So we start to give up on habits.
Habits are too hard to build.
Targets are easier to achieve.
And once achieved, move to the next one.

We live one goal to the other."
9781,2021-06-18 05:36:53+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 8:
Kids form habits

Kids don't set goals.
They have no place to be.
They have no targets to achieve.

They are simply an outcome of the things they do everyday, or we tell them to do everyday!

From brushing, to reading, to watching TV, to playing.
They follow habits!"
9782,2021-06-18 05:36:52+00:00,warikoo,"But we?
We know HOW to hug, but we don't
We know HOW to kiss, but we hesitate
We know HOW to smile, but we stop
We know HOW to snuggle, but we resist

We laugh, we cry, we are sad, we are happy - and yet we feel heavy.
Because we have learnt how to stop ourselves from expressing."
9783,2021-06-18 05:36:52+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 6:
Kids express their emotions. They don't hide them.

They hug.
They kiss.
They smile.
They snuggle.
They laugh.
They cry.
They are sad when you leave.
And happy when you arrive."
9784,2021-06-18 05:36:52+00:00,warikoo,"And then the prescriptions start.

You will get hurt.
You will get dirty.
You will fall sick.
You will fall short.
You will fall.
You will fail.

DON'T DO THIS!
You will fail!

We kill the adventure!"
9785,2021-06-18 05:36:51+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 5:
Kids don't see risk or failure. They just see adventure.

Climbing a chair isn't risky. 
It is adventurous.
Jumping off the bed isn't risky.
It is adventurous.
Playing in the mud isn't dirty.
It is adventurous.
Getting wet in the rain isn't risky.
It is adventurous."
9786,2021-06-18 05:36:51+00:00,warikoo,"And then bam!
The world takes over.

We begin to see color, race, religion, money, before we see the person.

We form opinions, before we form conversations."
9787,2021-06-18 05:36:50+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 4:
Kids don't judge

This fascinates me the most.
They do not see skin color, gender, religion, wealth.
They just see other kids that they can play with.
Or not.

For them, another kid's worth is determined by how much fun they have playing with that kid"
9788,2021-06-18 05:36:50+00:00,warikoo,"Kids are always living in the moment.
They are intently focused on the now!

And then we tell them to start thinking of the future.
""What will you do once you grow up?""

All they wanted was to enjoy now.
We told them you could enjoy tomorrow, if you gave up on now!"
9789,2021-06-18 05:36:49+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 3:
There is no future or past. Everything is now!

Ever seen a kid wondering about the future? Stressed about it? Excited about it?
Rarely.
They don't think about the future.

Ever seen them remember details of the past, thus reigniting the emotions they felt then?
No!"
9790,2021-06-18 05:36:49+00:00,warikoo,"We are told to listen and not ask.
We are rebuked if the questions are ""dumb""
We are discouraged if the questions are too many.

We were all curious. 
Until the world killed the curiosity!"
9791,2021-06-18 05:36:49+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 2:
We were born with curiosity.

EVERY kid is curious.
They ask endless questions.
Whether to know, to irritate or to engage.
But questions they ask.

And then parents and school crush that curiosity."
9792,2021-06-18 05:36:48+00:00,warikoo,"But as grow up, logic takes over.
1+1 becomes 2 and nothing else.
History becomes fact and nothing more.
Nature becomes evolution and nothing beyond.

And we forget how much we loved stories.

We forgot how, hearing stories, makes us go back to who we were!"
9793,2021-06-18 05:36:48+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson 1:
Stories drive our understanding of the world

As kids, all we heard were stories. 
True stories.
Fiction.
Mythology.

And these stories shaped up our worldview.
Our fears, hopes, desires and imagination stems from these stories."

I panicked when markets tanked.
I stressed when I couldn't find buyers.

No one starts up to lose.

No one starts up to be defeated.

So if they are going through a tough time, it is not because of lack of will, or intent or commitment.

Be kind.

We think decisions are irreversible

Most decisions, in our head, cannot be changed.

We know others through their actions.
We know ourselves through our thoughts.

We often find ourselves asking ""how is it not obvious to them, if its obvious to me?""
Because they do not know our thoughts.
They only know us because of what we have done/said."

""Why am I feeling angry/sad/jealous/hate...?""

It is magic!"
10734,2021-04-09 07:10:17+00:00,warikoo,"Bitter Truth #7
We do not try to find out why we feel what we feel.

If we feel something we do not wish to feel (anger, jealousy, hatred, sadness), our reaction is to attempt to stop the emotion.

But we cannot stop emotions.
We can only understand them."

We are rarely curious

School, college, parents, the world over time, systematically, killed our curiosity.

We play to our strengths"

I call the shots

My natural leadership style is that of extreme autonomy.

No ESOPs. Profit Sharing instead

At nearbuy, we gave ESOPs to everyone.

10961,2021-03-26 06:22:58+00:00,warikoo,"Today, I am taking it slow.

In the absence of it, we are left to learn from those who have made mistakes and realized what to do.
Or make those same mistakes ourselves."

Not taking risks, when you can

In our 20s, when we have little to lose. And even if we do lose, we have time to recover. 
Lesser so in our 30s/40s
That's why our parents love FDs.
But we shouldn't.

Take risks early on. 
And don't worry about the short term ups and downs."
11597,2021-02-12 06:04:23+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 10:
Running after money

Money gives you freedom. 
Freedom is a privilege.
But the minute we run after money, we are not free anymore.

Use money to earn your freedom.
Don't give up your freedom to earn money."
11598,2021-02-12 06:04:22+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 9:
Comparing your money to others

Money, for most of us, is an outcome. Not an input. 
It is the result of the decisions we have made, not the reason for the decisions we made.

Compare the decisions people made to get to their money.
Comparing the outcome, won't help!"
11599,2021-02-12 06:04:22+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 8:
Investing late

20s is the time to have fun. Will start investing in the 30s.
30s is the time to build a family and enjoy. Will start investing in the 40s.

The right time to start investing was when you turned 18.
The next best time is TODAY."
11600,2021-02-12 06:04:21+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 7:
Renting your time and not owning any assets

Everyone in a job isn't going to create supernormal wealth.
Because we have to spend time working, to earn.

Assets, on the other hand, make money, even when we sleep.
Start a company. Own stocks. Create rental income."

Investing because of FOMO

No one knows the highs or lows of a market. The best way to invest over a long term, is to invest regularly. Irrespective of the price at that time."
11603,2021-02-12 06:04:20+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 4:
Believing that our income is capped

Our income is not capped. There is no upper limit to how much we can earn.
Instead, it is our spending that is capped. We have to spend a bare minimum to live, to survive.

Instead of reducing expenses, focus on increasing income"
11604,2021-02-12 06:04:19+00:00,warikoo,"Mistake 3:
Taking too many loans

We over-index on our future earnings.
And spend more today, than we can afford today.

Loans tie us down.
They increase our burn rate.
They make us risk-averse.
They make us feel like we are stuck!"

Spending your time on things that are easy to measure money-wise

But we won't spend 2 hours preparing for our salary negotiation!"

Not valuing your time and treating it like its free

Will you do it even if no one ever knew?

Behind every fear, is a person you want to be."
11692,2021-02-05 06:13:56+00:00,warikoo,"Question 11:
What do they know that I do not know?

Every time we disagree with someone's views, it is because they see the world differently from us and know something that we don't.

Finding that out, makes us more aware.
We don't have to agree. But we have to understand."
11693,2021-02-05 06:13:56+00:00,warikoo,"Question 10:
Is this urgent? 

Most things that we think are important are not important. They are just urgent. 
But because the urgent things are shouting on top of their voices to be heard, they seem important.

Being aware of the difference, makes all the difference."
11694,2021-02-05 06:13:55+00:00,warikoo,"Question 9:
Whose view of me, matters the most to me, right now?

We are, all the time, trying to create an image. An image of ourselves in front of someone else. 

It is important to always know who that someone else is.
Could we our own self."
11695,2021-02-05 06:13:55+00:00,warikoo,"Question 8:
Why might I be feeling this way? 

I am angry. What about this situation makes me angry? Why do I think this makes me angry?
I am jealous. Why?
I am unhappy. Why?

There is always a reason. Once we find that reason, the reason for that emotion to exist goes away."
11696,2021-02-05 06:13:54+00:00,warikoo,"Question 7:
Do they give me energy or take energy from me?

People, after every interaction, either leave you with more energy than you had, or less energy than you had. 
Who are you spending more time with?"
11697,2021-02-05 06:13:54+00:00,warikoo,"Question 6:
What is the worst thing that will happen? Will I be ok if it happens?

Our mind wants to protect us from danger. So it creates worst case scenarios and forces us to not take action.
Once we imagine them vividly we realize that most worst cases are not that bad."
11698,2021-02-05 06:13:53+00:00,warikoo,"Question 5:
Will this matter 3 months from now?

Our emotions are real. So real that they seem permanent. 
But they are not.
Once the emotions are gone and we have given ourselves time and space, will what we are going through still matter?"
11699,2021-02-05 06:13:53+00:00,warikoo,"Question 4:
Forget the world. WHAT DO I WANT?

We do not realize how much of our life we end up living because the world tells us that is the way to live life.
Have we ever stopped to ask, if that is what we want to do?"
11700,2021-02-05 06:13:52+00:00,warikoo,"Question 3:
What is this telling me?

""I haven't been able to raise funds for a year now""
What is this telling me?

""Every time I wake up I feel tired""
What is this telling me?

Our emotions/situations/circumstances are always telling us something.
Listen to them."
11701,2021-02-05 06:13:52+00:00,warikoo,"Question 2:
What else could this mean?

""My boss isn't talking to me because she hates me!""
""What else could it mean?""

""I am not happy, but this must be just a phase""
""What else could it mean?""

Go beyond your most obvious explanations."
11702,2021-02-05 06:13:51+00:00,warikoo,"Question 1:
Do I need this or do I want this?

Need is a necessity. Want is a desire.
Whatever is it that you are going after, is that a necessity or a desire?

It is amazing how much of our time goes in fulfilling desires, disregarding our needs."

Avoid loans.

https://t.co/ESS43XzOXx"
12747,2020-11-27 05:43:30+00:00,warikoo,"I knew what it was to live without money.
But I didn't know what it was to live without happiness.

Today, one of my key goals is to give my parents all the money they need. To do whatever they want.
They already know what it is to be happy :)"
12748,2020-11-27 05:43:29+00:00,warikoo,"4 of us on our Bajaj scooter, going to India Gate with a bag containing a pressure cooker full of peas pulao, a sheet to sit on, plates and cutlery.
Ending the evening with the 5 rupee ice candy from kwality.

I guess this is where I got the courage to pursue happiness."
12749,2020-11-27 05:43:29+00:00,warikoo,"And I am convinced that most of what we are today, is because of the upbringing we had.

We lived a life without money, in extreme conditions quite often, but we always made sure we had a good time."
12750,2020-11-27 05:43:28+00:00,warikoo,"And it often makes me cry to realize how much they went through just to ensure that my sister and I got the best we could.

We went to good schools, we were given the freedom to live our lives, we were always loved and taken care of."
12751,2020-11-27 05:43:28+00:00,warikoo,"Both Ma Papa come from Srinagar, where they grew up with little to no privilege.
They did not go to any top school. 
They did not have any stamp that would set them for life.

They just worked their way through. Like most others in their generation."
12752,2020-11-27 05:43:27+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Perfection is personal.
It is what makes others wonder. But for you it is the only way you know!"
12753,2020-11-27 05:43:27+00:00,warikoo,"Ma always stood for perfection. But she has a very interesting and inspiring definition it.

Perfection is when you do something with such finesse that people are left amazed at how you even did it.
But for you, it is not a big deal. 
It is a habit. 
It is natural."
12754,2020-11-27 05:43:26+00:00,warikoo,"I have lost count of the times Papa would step into a situation whenever everything else has failed and redeem the moment.

Be it as trivial as ""wedding guests have arrived and the food isn't even prepared"" to as critical as ""where we will arrange money for his ticket to the US?"""
12755,2020-11-27 05:43:25+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Respect doesn't come from title, age or experience.
It comes from conduct."

It was a request.
For me to consider something.
I politely declined, but realized how blessed I was to have parents who would ""request"" theirs kids to consider."
12757,2020-11-27 05:43:24+00:00,warikoo,"I dropped out of my PhD and came back to India. At 24, I had no plans, no goals, no direction, no money. Ma Papa weren't too happy, but to their credit they did their best to hide their anguish.

One day, still remember I was brushing my teeth, Ma comes sheepishly to me and says"
12758,2020-11-27 05:43:24+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
If you do not believe in yourself, no one else will."
12759,2020-11-27 05:43:23+00:00,warikoo,"Be is a family gathering, a wedding ceremony or even a normal dinner, Papa will always carry his book of Kashmiri Songs.
In the hope that someone asks him to sings.
He believes he sings well (and he does).
So he can't fathom why people won't ask him to sing :)"
12760,2020-11-27 05:43:23+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Never forget where you have come from."
12761,2020-11-27 05:43:22+00:00,warikoo,"Whenever I won any award or did anything praise-worthy, Ma would of course be happy, but she would instantly shower her favorite blessing

(May god always keep you grounded)"
12762,2020-11-27 05:43:22+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Nothing matters more in life than showing up everyday.
To your work, to your responsibilities, to your relationships."
12763,2020-11-27 05:43:21+00:00,warikoo,"Papa struggled his entire professional life. His risks didn't pay off, we were perpetually in debt, went through some extremely tough times financially.

But one thing that never changed was how hard he continued to work.
I was always amazed. Always wondered what kept him going."
12764,2020-11-27 05:43:21+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
It is just as important to ask ""What will they be thinking"" as it is to ask ""How am I feeling?"""
12765,2020-11-27 05:43:20+00:00,warikoo,"Ma is one of the most empathetic people I know.
Her sensitivity is her super power, because she has a knack for knowing what the other person might be feeling.

Whenever there was a conflict in my head or I was angry at someone, she always used to ask, ""Woh kya soch rahe honge?"""
12766,2020-11-27 05:43:20+00:00,warikoo,"Lesson:
Risk and Failure is a state of mind.
There should never be any fear.
And no regret."
12767,2020-11-27 05:43:19+00:00,warikoo,"Papa took a risk. And it didn't pay off. 

He could never recover from it. 
But he would take the same risk if he had to."
12768,2020-11-27 05:43:19+00:00,warikoo,"I remember sitting as a family, filling ballpen refills because he was paid for every 100 pens filled.
I remember days when Ma Papa had just 1 meal a day.

But my sister and I went to the best schools possible.
We knew we didn't have money, but were never made to feel so."
12769,2020-11-27 05:43:18+00:00,warikoo,"Papa joined a young company as a sales rep. Within a year, he got a call from another company. 2X salary plus a car. This was 1985. And a big deal.
He took the offer.

2 years down, the company shuts.
The company he quit, Ranbaxy, becomes a giant.

13372,2020-10-16 05:44:16+00:00,warikoo,"8.
While I read in any posture, the ""concept application"" process (Step 5) is done formally.
On a table, with a pen and paper.
It isn't recreation.
It is like work.
It is work."
13373,2020-10-16 05:44:16+00:00,warikoo,"7. 
I do not read multiple books at the same time. I know of a lot of people who do, but I haven't found it work for me.

I would much rather stop reading a book after 2 days, because I am not enjoying it, than pick up a book simultaneously as an excuse."
13374,2020-10-16 05:44:15+00:00,warikoo,"Most of my aha moments in life have come from these book-cricket reading sessions.

I remember playing book-cricket with ""Hard Things about Hard things"" for 30 straight days in 2017, during a rough patch running nearbuy.

Every day the book spoke to me, like a mentor!"
13375,2020-10-16 05:44:15+00:00,warikoo,"I play with these re-read books, as we used to play book cricket.
I pick up a random book, open up a random page and just stand in front of the library for 5-10 mins reading the rest of the chapter.

No agenda, no expectation, no pressure.
Directionless reading."
13376,2020-10-16 05:44:14+00:00,warikoo,"6. 
If I am left impressed with how powerful the book's concepts were or how excited I am to apply them to my life, I decide to buy the book in the paper format. 

These paper books find space in our library and become re-reads."
13377,2020-10-16 05:44:14+00:00,warikoo,"Books are powerful not because of the stories they narrate.
It is because how they help us see other stories in a different way."
13378,2020-10-16 05:44:13+00:00,warikoo,"I sit down, read a sentence and then ""force"" myself to imagine - where can I apply this in my life?

It is my favorite game to play.
Think for a moment how powerful this is, if done with discipline and regular frequency.

You begin to see different topics converge."
13379,2020-10-16 05:44:13+00:00,warikoo,"This is also the time, when I try and find patterns and connections with these concepts. Because (remember?), the context was removed from the highlights. 

So now whatever is being read, is being read in isolation, in a pure form, with no bias, no attachment and no background."
13380,2020-10-16 05:44:12+00:00,warikoo,"5. 
Once done, I export the highlights of the book into a PDF. 

And after 2-3 weeks, revisit the PDF.

By this time, I have forgotten most of what I had read, at least in my conscious memory.
So this PDF helps immensely in bringing back the concepts."
13381,2020-10-16 05:44:12+00:00,warikoo,"A book has to earn your attention and interest
Not the other way around."
13382,2020-10-16 05:44:11+00:00,warikoo,"4. 
Which also means, I do not finish most books I start.

This was a big shift from before, when I used to feel guilty leaving a book unfinished. 
Some 5 years back, I heard @naval and his approach towards books, so changed mine too."
13383,2020-10-16 05:44:11+00:00,warikoo,"I end up reading for 3.5-5hrs per week and that, along with skimming, is enough for me to finish most books in a week. 

Some books take time and deserve that time as well, so I put no pressure on myself to complete a book."
13384,2020-10-16 05:44:10+00:00,warikoo,"3. 
While reading, I skim a lot. 
I do not read every line, nor try and memorize every character (if reading an auto/biography) 

Since I read only non-fiction, I can afford to do so. It also helps me speed up my reading."
13385,2020-10-16 05:44:10+00:00,warikoo,"For ex:
""What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.""
This sentence in Rework (link at end of thread) is in the context of a business idea.

With the context removed, it applies to virtually anything we do in life."
13386,2020-10-16 05:44:09+00:00,warikoo,"2. 
I read all my books on my Kindle.
And I highlight obsessively, while reading.

While highlighting, I remove the context from the conclusion, so that later, I can apply the conclusion to any context as against being boxed by its original context."
13387,2020-10-16 05:44:09+00:00,warikoo,"So today, it is a habit. 
My brain dispenses the least amount of energy required, to read.
It has been trained how to.

It happens automatically, without much thought.
Like brushing one's teeth."
13388,2020-10-16 05:44:08+00:00,warikoo,"1. 
I read every morning, for 30-45 mins. 
This is after 90 mins of waking up, once I am done with my meditation, my singing and my ""sipping water like wine"" routine (a story for another day)

13505,2020-10-09 05:56:37+00:00,warikoo,"Because today, I chose to define my success and my failure, instead of allowing the world to define it for me.

My relationship with myself today is one where I am aware of what I am feeling and I try to answer why, almost always.
Its a relationship that grows"
13506,2020-10-09 05:56:36+00:00,warikoo,"I still suffer from imposter syndrome, I still think of myself as a failure, I know I have let so many people down

But the difference is that of these thoughts drive me to become a better person, as against shutting me down.
I find strength from my failures."
13507,2020-10-09 05:56:36+00:00,warikoo,"I realize today, that almost all the mistakes I made in my relationships, stemmed from the relationship I had with my own self.

And the day I was able to fix my relationship with myself, I gave myself the opportunity to fix all my relationships."
13508,2020-10-09 05:56:35+00:00,warikoo,"That's when it struck me.

At times the most toxic relationship you have to save yourself from, is the one you have with your own self."
13509,2020-10-09 05:56:35+00:00,warikoo,"Once a friend asked me, when was the last time you shouted at someone, were rude to someone, abused someone, hurt someone, blamed someone?

I couldn't remember and replied, ""not anytime recently""

""Then how is it that you do the same things to yourself?"""
13510,2020-10-09 05:56:34+00:00,warikoo,"For the longest time I blamed myself for everything.
I was inadequate.
I was responsible.
I was incapable.
I was wrong.
I was a failure.

And that affected my relationships.
I over compensated.
I was needy.
I sought validation."
13511,2020-10-09 05:56:34+00:00,warikoo,"Acknowledgement doesn't always comes in words. 
It also comes through actions.
Sometimes even through silence, if you care enough to listen.

If you crave for acknowledgement, you may or may not find it.
If you do things without it's need, you will find it in surprising ways."
13512,2020-10-09 05:56:33+00:00,warikoo,"I craved for acknowledgement in all my relationships.
I craved for a ""thank you"" whenever I did something.
I craved for a ""you are awesome"" whenever I helped someone.

If people didn't acknowledge, they were not doing their part in a relationship."
13513,2020-10-09 05:56:33+00:00,warikoo,"In a relationship, it is always easy to think ""they don't understand me""

How often do we ask, ""do I understand them?"""
13514,2020-10-09 05:56:32+00:00,warikoo,"It angered me that my parents did not understand why I left my PhD, why I left my cushy consulting job, why I left my startup.
They don't understand me, was all that I could think of.

It have been easy though for me to see how their life experiences had shaped their reality."
13515,2020-10-09 05:56:32+00:00,warikoo,"I always wanted to solve people's problems.
I heard them out and my instant reaction thereafter was to make a plan to fix things.
I thought I was being helpful in the relationship.

Quite often, the best gift you can give a relationship is the ability to listen.
Just listen."
13516,2020-10-09 05:56:31+00:00,warikoo,"People change. 
They always do.
Because of which relationships also change.

If you keep telling people ""you have changed"", then it is most likely you who has to change."
13517,2020-10-09 05:56:31+00:00,warikoo,"After the birth of our first child, my wife dedicated herself to become a mother.
While I needed her to still play the role of my friend and partner.
I felt dismissed when the mother in her took over my friend."
13518,2020-10-09 05:56:30+00:00,warikoo,"A relationship can take multiple avataars.

If we do not know which is the most important one for us at that point of time in life, we will fail in all versions of the relationship."
13519,2020-10-09 05:56:30+00:00,warikoo,"I became friends with my colleagues, but that made it hard for me to be direct and radical with them. 
My friendship superseded my responsibility as a leader. 
I started to fail as a leader, while being a good friend."
13520,2020-10-09 05:56:29+00:00,warikoo,"I justified spending insane hours at work because I was doing this for ""our future""
And the next thing I know, our son was 4 years old.

Relationships may or may not have a future.
But all of them have a present.
This moment, right now.
The relationship needs this moment."
13521,2020-10-09 05:56:29+00:00,warikoo,"I felt I will keep my parents happy with the money I make.
I will send them on vacations, buy them things, make their life comfortable. 
But the busier I got, the less happy they were, despite all the things they now had.

Relationships do not need things to grow.
They need time."
13522,2020-10-09 05:56:28+00:00,warikoo,"I thought it is my responsibility to keep the other person happy.
If they are unhappy, then I am at fault, I am incapable, I am inadequate.

The best relationships are those where people take responsibility for their own happiness."
13523,2020-10-09 05:56:28+00:00,warikoo,"I continued to be in toxic friendships, because how could I be selfish and leave them now?
I continued to be friends with people who had long stopped growing, just because we'd been friends for long.

Sometimes killing a relationship is the only way to save yourself from it."
13524,2020-10-09 05:56:27+00:00,warikoo,"I always wanted to know how I could help them.
I always wanted to know what was wrong.
But I never shared how they could help me.
Even when asked, I never shared what was wrong at my end.

People want the joy of being able to help you, just as much as you seek that joy from them."
13525,2020-10-09 05:56:27+00:00,warikoo,"I always sugar coated my feedback, even when I felt strongly that they had done something wrong.
I felt I would come across as rude.
I felt they will feel bad about themselves.

People who wish to grow always seek feedback.
Diluting the feedback is disrespectful to them."

There is a great book 
Thinking fast, Thinking Slow which is a wonderful introduction to this concept (and a lot of powerful concepts)
https://t.co/bqY9g4K0fp"
13595,2020-10-03 04:30:40+00:00,warikoo,"But if we didn't do well as a company and had to cut down the variable pay from 30 to 20, thus bringing the CTC to 120, people were far angrier than they were happy when it went from 100 to 130

The drop from 130 to 120 affected them more
Than the gain from 100 to 130"
13596,2020-10-03 04:30:40+00:00,warikoo,"The biggest impact I saw though was in running the company

If people had a fixed salary of 100 and variable expected pay of 10, their CTC was 110
If we announced the variable pay has been increased to 30, people were happy.
Their CTC was now 130"
13597,2020-10-03 04:30:40+00:00,warikoo,"If we showed deals that had already expired in the search results, that would drive higher conversion, than if we only showed live deals.

Because people realized they lost out on something. The pain from that was greater."
13598,2020-10-03 04:30:39+00:00,warikoo,"If a deal said
Get Rs. 500 off
That was better than saying Get 50% off - even if both options gave the same results"
13599,2020-10-03 04:30:39+00:00,warikoo,"If a deal had 2 choices
Option 1: Pick from 1 starter, 1 main course and 1 dessert (equivalent to sure shot option)
Option 2: Get X% off on the entire bill (equivalent to spin the wheel)

People opted for Option 1. 
Because they didn't know beforehand what they would order."
13600,2020-10-03 04:30:38+00:00,warikoo,"Which in other words means, 
so called Risk averse people (in Poll 1 who took the sure shot) become risk loving when it comes to avoiding loss.

This seems very intuitive and obvious, but when described with data in 1979 was path breaking.

We used to use this a lot at nearbuy"
13601,2020-10-03 04:30:38+00:00,warikoo,"It also said
People are far likelier to gamble to avoid sure shot loss (another way of describing loss aversion)
Which explains poll 2 results
70% would spin the wheel rather than take the sure shot loss

You increase the sure shot loss amount and even more people will gamble."
13602,2020-10-03 04:30:37+00:00,warikoo,"You increase the amount to 1L - this 60% will become even higher. 

You increase it to 1Cr - and almost everyone will take the sure shot.

Mathematically, the expected outcome is the same
100% of sure shot amount = 50% of double the sure shot amount

But people are not rational"
13603,2020-10-03 04:30:37+00:00,warikoo,"A layman summary of the theory is
Pain from loss &gt;&gt; Pleasure from gain

It said
People are willing to take a sure shot than gamble on getting higher gains (another form of loss aversion) - which is shown in Poll 1
(60% took the sure shot Rs. 500)"
13604,2020-10-03 04:30:36+00:00,warikoo,"This picture is a real-life proof (take it for what it's worth) of the Prospect Theory - which was presented by Dan Kahneman and Amos Traversky in a seminal paper in 1979 
https://t.co/q8pDKPSCZw

They (actually only Kahneman) went on win the Nobel prize in 2002."

If you do not ask, the answer is always no

The biggest thing that has enabled this?
My imagination

The biggest thing that could have hindered this?
My imagination"
13618,2020-10-02 05:58:32+00:00,warikoo,"The habit to use this gift of imagination, to drive me, to propel me towards action, to pursue what I wish to pursue.

And its staggering how many people do not realize how their imagination hinders all of the above. I have seen it with the best of mind."
13619,2020-10-02 05:58:32+00:00,warikoo,"But instead, I imagined them to reply.
I imagined someone in the team to say, let's do it. It will make us look good.
I imagined the world being still the same, even if I didn't get the feature.

And I see that as a recurring thing in my life."
13620,2020-10-02 05:58:31+00:00,warikoo,"And in my experience, it is a habit that we can develop.
The habit to not imagine the worst, as if it were to happen.
But to be aware of the worst, as if to prepare for it.

That day in August, I could have imagined no one to ever reply.
People to laugh at me at that post."
13621,2020-10-02 05:58:31+00:00,warikoo,"Hesitate to ask
Hesitate to do something we want to do
Hesitate to explore what we wish to explore

We hesitate.
Our imagination, that has gotten us so far, also prevents most of us to move ahead."
13622,2020-10-02 05:58:31+00:00,warikoo,"You want to ask a question?
People will laugh at you, when you do.
Mock you.
Tell you that you are stupid.

And as you imagine this, your brain tells you, why bother.
Don't ask.
Protect yourself from this potential harm.

So we hesitate!"
13623,2020-10-02 05:58:30+00:00,warikoo,"Because when we want to do something, we begin to imagine.
We begin to imagine what would happen once we do that thing?
And our mind, imagines the worst.
Because its designed to protect us!"
13624,2020-10-02 05:58:30+00:00,warikoo,"We could imagine solutions to our problems.
We could imagine a better way of doing things.
We could imagine a better world.

And we did.
The world is far far better than it used to.
And continues to be, over long term.

But
This imagination also fails us. Every day."
13625,2020-10-02 05:58:29+00:00,warikoo,"Our ability to imagine.

Humans can imagine.
We can imagine stories.
We can imagine the future.
We can imagine things that don't exist. That haven't happened.

And this imagination has helped us tremendously."
13626,2020-10-02 05:58:29+00:00,warikoo,"Since then, I have posted over 600 hours of video content on LinkedIn, have amassed 860,000+ followers and warikoo Wednesdays became a property that people know me from.

But the point of this thread wasn't this humblebrag.

13627,2020-10-02 05:58:28+00:00,warikoo,"Seriously!?
That's what it took?
A post - asking for it?

It was a Wednesday.

And I posted this on LinkedIn
(PS: Jeff was the CEO of LinkedIn back then)

In an hour, a product manager from LinkedIn reached out and said, ""we have activated the feature for you!"""
13629,2020-10-02 05:58:27+00:00,warikoo,"The video feature was launched, but even after 3 months, I didn't have access.
And everyday I saw videos from American entrepreneurs, business leaders and I was like, ""Does this come to India at all?""

So one day, in August 2016, which happened to be a Wednesday, I wrote a post."
13630,2020-10-02 05:58:27+00:00,warikoo,"But by then Youtube had already become big and I was late to the game.
So when LinkedIn announced their video feature, I thought that could be an interesting platform to explore.

I had begun to see some early success, pasting my blog posts onto LinkedIn.

I was at 40K followers!"
13631,2020-10-02 05:58:26+00:00,warikoo,"But by 2015-16, people had stopped reading.
Reading wasn't what most people did anymore.
They had moved to watching videos.

Jio had just launched.
And video consumption was picking up.

So I thought - why don't I write my blog, but also convert that into a video?"
13632,2020-10-02 05:58:26+00:00,warikoo,"I was experiencing so much, on a daily basis.
Making mistakes left, right and center.
Course correcting.
My biases were being challenged.

And I was learning so, so much!

The blog began to reflect that.
And people began to read it.

Do not take loans for your desires.

7. Take loans only for things that appreciate in value. Education. Maybe a house. Only one!"

How to grow it.

Challenged her to a return comparison at the end of the decade.

It was her investment that saved us.

13705,2020-09-25 05:08:49+00:00,warikoo,"Whenever in need of money, I broke my MF and FD to generate cash.
I basically broke compounding.

I persisted with it during the painful slow growth period.
And just when it was about to take off, I clipped its wings."
13706,2020-09-25 05:08:48+00:00,warikoo,"I invested in stocks when the markets when high, in the hope of making fast money.

It should have been the exact opposite."

Continued to maintain my lifestyle when I should have lowered it.

Took on more debt.

All in the hope that one mega event in the future will solve all of it."
13708,2020-09-25 05:08:47+00:00,warikoo,"For an entire decade I took lower than market salary, over indexing on equity.
I believed the equity will make me much much more than the salary ever would.

So when things didn't end up the way it was expected, I was left with no wealth."
13709,2020-09-25 05:08:47+00:00,warikoo,"I invested in illiquid assets - startups, real estate.
And rarely in liquid assets - stocks, gold.

So when tough times happened, I had a lot of ""paper wealth"" but no cash.
Which meant taking even more debt.

Never trying to paying it back. 
Because hey, the previous tweet!"
13710,2020-09-25 05:08:47+00:00,warikoo,"Whenever I made any extra cash, instead of paying off the loan, I invested it in startups.
Convinced that the startup will multiply my money several times over.

That's what I did!"
13711,2020-09-25 05:08:46+00:00,warikoo,"I took loans to buy real estate.
Assuming the price appreciation will take care of the interest rate I pay.

I didn't take into account taxes
I didn't take into account inflation

I didn't do the math that to get a respectable return, the price will have to grow ~20% yoy"
13712,2020-09-25 05:08:46+00:00,warikoo,"What I didn't realize though that this desire to dismiss money, led me to disrespect it.

Because I had a knack of making money, I never really spent any effort in understanding how to maintain and grow it.

In the process making a lot of mistakes."
13713,2020-09-25 05:08:45+00:00,warikoo,"We grew up without any money.
Perpetually in debt. Hand to mouth existence.

Which is why I grew up hating money.
I thought it was the cause of all our problems.

Everyone wants their business card to say ""I'm CEO, Bitch""

But the idea in our head of a startup is very grand.
It is raising money, it is becoming a unicorn, it is to rake in the millions.

We rarely recognize, all big stories started small."
13956,2020-09-11 05:30:16+00:00,warikoo,"I have benefited immensely from this process.

&gt; It helps me think through the idea in detail.
&gt; It allows me to test the reaction of people I do not know and thus can't directly influence.
&gt; It gives me data to back my intuition."
13957,2020-09-11 05:30:16+00:00,warikoo,"In summary:

7-step process to validate an idea
1. Name the idea
2. Define what the idea does (function) and what it solves (purpose)
3. Design a logo 
4. Book a domain
5. Create a landing page to share idea and collect email
6. Run ads on Google/FB/IG 
7. Measure CTR/CPC/CPA"
13958,2020-09-11 05:30:15+00:00,warikoo,"At the end of 14-days, you will have data for the campaigns you have run for your ideas.

This data is NOWHERE close to the actual reality, however acts as a very effective comparison tool to select which idea to pursue further.

So do not use this method for just 1 idea."
13959,2020-09-11 05:30:15+00:00,warikoo,"3. CPA (Cost-per-action)
At what cost was an email collected

This shows potential cost of generating leads.

Side Metric:
Conversion rate
% of people who filled up their email after landing on the page
Anything less than 10% is either b/c of a poor landing page or a poor idea."
13960,2020-09-11 05:30:14+00:00,warikoo,"2. CPC (Cost-per-click)
At what cost was this click generated

This shows potential cost of generating awareness.
It will vary, by design, for search and videos ads. 
And by geography (if you have selected multiple countries)"
13961,2020-09-11 05:30:14+00:00,warikoo,"Step 7: Measure
Measure essentially 3 things

1. CTR (Click-through-rate)
% of people who saw the ad &amp; clicked on it
In Google search, this shows interest in the idea, when the need is explicit
In video ads, this shows interest in the idea, when the need is implicit"
13962,2020-09-11 05:30:13+00:00,warikoo,"Ideally you should not spend more than Rs. 3,000 cumulatively on this campaign. 

And run it for 14 days, to cover potential differences in weekday/weekends/start-end of the month etc"

&gt; App: Enter email to get download link
&gt; B2B saas: Enter email to setup demo
&gt; Clothing brand: Enter email to get catalogue
&gt; Offline store: Enter email to get discount coupons
etc 

PS: You aren't really sending them anything. Its fake"
13964,2020-09-11 05:30:12+00:00,warikoo,"Earlier search used to work far better for me. 
Today video works much better. 
Find out what works for you.

When people click the ad, take them to the landing page.

There, you will speak about the idea, showcase the product and finally,
Ask for their email"
13965,2020-09-11 05:30:12+00:00,warikoo,"On google search, the intent is explicit - so you have to spend time thinking ""what is it that potential users will be searching for, when they would want this product?""

On display and video, the intent is implicit - so you have to think of ""what message will get them to click?"""
13966,2020-09-11 05:30:11+00:00,warikoo,"Step 6: Run Google, FB, IG ads
With a budget of max Rs.200 per day, run search, display and video ads for 14 days.

Do not worry if you do not know how to. In less than 5 hours, the best instructors can teach you through courses on @udemy, @coursera - it's a life skill to acquire"
13967,2020-09-11 05:30:11+00:00,warikoo,"Invest your time in being true to the eventual form of the idea, the way you have imagined it.

Do not invest your time in mockups or designs or creating something. 

Remember, at this stage you are testing the idea, not the product!"
13968,2020-09-11 05:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"If the idea is a 

&gt; book - build a landing page writing about the book, reviews, testimonials etc
&gt; app - what the app does, screenshots (doesn't need to be of your app), play store reviews (fake)
&gt; B2B saas - how it works, which brands use it (fake), testimonials"
13969,2020-09-11 05:30:10+00:00,warikoo,"Step 5: Build a landing page for your idea
This is the most important step

Using a site builder (plenty of them - @Wix, @GoDaddy, @squarespace), build a digital brochure for your idea.

Something that piques the interest of those visiting the page."
13970,2020-09-11 05:30:09+00:00,warikoo,"Step 4: Book the domain

This is important for the next few steps.

Again, do not worry whether this is the final name and identity for the idea.
Book something long-tail"
13971,2020-09-11 05:30:09+00:00,warikoo,"Step 3: Design a logo

Basis step 2, creating a visual identity that makes the idea more real.
You begin to see it, imagine its positioning, imagine the emotions it will generate

Earlier, I used to find inspiration online and then make it on PPT
Today, I spend $5-15 on @fiverr"
13972,2020-09-11 05:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"Step 2: Define what the idea does and what it solves

What the idea does is the function of the idea 
(Zoom allows video meetings)

What it solves is the purpose of the idea
(Zooms allows people to connect remotely)

This takes time. 
Should take time."
13973,2020-09-11 05:30:08+00:00,warikoo,"Step 1: Name the idea

For me, naming something is critical. 
It adds emotions to my thinking process.
It feels important.
The idea becomes a personality.

Don't worry about the name being perfect (or even the final name, should you work on the idea)
Key is for it to have a name"
13974,2020-09-11 05:30:07+00:00,warikoo,"At the end of the shower, I invariably had a lot more clarity about the idea than I did going in.

90% of my ideas never make it beyond the shower test.

If a higher percentage of your ideas make it through, you are not being harsh enough."
13975,2020-09-11 05:30:06+00:00,warikoo,"1. The shower test (or Balti test - doesn't matter)
While taking a shower, ask yourself all possible questions about the idea that your worst enemy would ask.

&gt; Why
&gt; Why

Mostly really bad ones. 
Occasionally good ones.

And it got to a point where I had to find a way to objectively select or reject an idea.

They want to be led. Not managed."

14481,2020-08-21 06:13:51+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed people will be ok if we lay them off and find them another job.

No!

I would raise tons of money, be worth millions.

Never start up because you want to make money from it.

14483,2020-08-21 06:13:50+00:00,warikoo,"I felt VCs were in the business of building businesses together with the founders.
And our interests were thus aligned.

VCs are in the business of entering and exiting businesses. 
And that often means, the interests will eventually clash."

When I worked the hardest ever, no one noticed.

I missed my friend, my confidant.
Because she was always busy in rearing our child.

It is only when both parents contribute in raising their child, that they keep their partnership alive."
14486,2020-08-21 06:13:49+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed everyone's definition of and motivation for success is the same.
That of glory. That of respect. That of inspiring others.

Everyone has a different definition of success.
And only if your work sets other people up for their success, will you be successful yourself."
14487,2020-08-21 06:13:49+00:00,warikoo,"I put all my savings into illiquid assets - real estate, startups.
And when we went through financial turmoil, we lived like urban poors.
Selling jewelry to make ends meet.

It is easy to cut a cheque.
Only when you see money come out of it, do you call it an investment!"
14488,2020-08-21 06:13:48+00:00,warikoo,"I felt having a second child would be a disaster.
It would make me feel even more guilt for not being present as a father to our son.

When you don't have anyone, you have your siblings.
And that's something you don't ask for. 
Your parents gift you that gift."
14489,2020-08-21 06:13:48+00:00,warikoo,"I managed everyone the same way.
My way.
The way that was easy for me, scalable for me, convenient for me.

If there is anything that should not scale with size, it is leadership.
It should get harder for you to lead, as you grow.
Because people are different.
They are not you!"
14490,2020-08-21 06:13:47+00:00,warikoo,"I told myself that relationships can wait.
That call to my parents can wait.
Saying ""I love you"" to my wife and kids can wait.
Spending time with them without my phone can wait.
I told myself, ""I don't have the time""

Time is the only thing that matters.
Everything else can wait."

It is the curse of leadership.

14819,2020-08-07 05:45:36+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed people will be ok if we lay them off and find them another job.

No!

It didn't.

14828,2020-08-07 05:45:32+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed that marketing was the only reason potential customers did not know of us.

That wasn't true.

Customers did not know of us because we hadn't yet built something that they wanted.
And marketing was never going to solve for that."

Everything wasn't fixed.

Raising money was not the end. It was the start.
I should have celebrated less and reflected more."
14830,2020-08-07 05:45:31+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed just because someone is good at their work, they will become good managers.

They necessarily don't.

Managing one self is easy. Managing people isn't. It requires training to be able to teach/coach/mentor someone else what you know inside of you."
14831,2020-08-07 05:45:30+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed that we are all new age and age-old biases do not exist in our minds.

They do exist!

If we had to fix the gender ratio, we had to focus on it. 
If we had to be inclusive, we had to focus on it. 
Assuming we are ""not like the others"", is not how biases are fixed."
14832,2020-08-07 05:45:30+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed that if I speak the most, there will be a lot more clarity.

There wasn't.

14833,2020-08-07 05:45:29+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed that if I said something needs to be done, it will get done, because everyone nodded.

It didn't get done.

I made the path clear. But I did a poor job of assigning roles that people had to play. So everyone agreed to the path. But they didn't know what to do!"
14834,2020-08-07 05:45:29+00:00,warikoo,"I assumed that if I sugar coat what I didn't like about their way of working, they will feel less hurt.

As a parent, don't allow that to happen.

Whenever they ask, engage. 
Not by answers.
Not by rejection.
But by questions."

15005,2020-07-31 06:23:56+00:00,warikoo,"Everyday, I get emails/messages from people seeking answers. And I sense their impatience and disappointment, when instead of the answers, I offer questions.

Because I believe that those questions will help them just as much as they have helped me. And helped me tremendously."
15006,2020-07-31 06:23:55+00:00,warikoo,"""What do they know that I do not know?""

The world has an insane amount of detail. And there are 2 ways to know those details.
Ask.
Or discover them yourselves.

It is so much easier to ask."
15007,2020-07-31 06:23:55+00:00,warikoo,"""How come this hasn't happened already?""

As an entrepreneur, we come to believe that our idea will work because WE are working on the idea.

We rarely go out seeking the answer to this question with the humility and curiosity of a child."
15008,2020-07-31 06:23:54+00:00,warikoo,"""What am I grateful for?""

There is so much to be grateful for. Heck, the fact that we are alive reading this, is enough to be grateful for.

But we take our lives for-granted. We assume we have unlimited time and all that we have is because we worked hard for it.
Both are lies."
15009,2020-07-31 06:23:53+00:00,warikoo,"""Why not?""

The goal of life is not to find the most comfortable chair for yourself and sit on it forever.
The goal of life is to sit on as many chairs as you can.

Redefine who you are.
All the time.

Because there is no you.
You are just a concept in your head."
15010,2020-07-31 06:23:53+00:00,warikoo,"""What's the worst thing that can happen?""

And am I ready to face that worst thing? 
Emotionally, socially, financially, psychologically, physically?

If yes, go for it!
If any iota of doubt, don't."
15011,2020-07-31 06:23:53+00:00,warikoo,"""What is my privilege?""

Everyday we sit on opportunities that people right outside our house will not get to see for even a second of their life. And they work harder than us, perhaps are even smarter than us.

Not all success is hard work. 
Not all failure is laziness."
15012,2020-07-31 06:23:52+00:00,warikoo,"""Is this MY definition of success? Or someone else's?""

The world begins defining your success from Day1. Grades, careers, jobs, marriage, money, looks, accent - everything!
And we rarely stop to ask, are we living our life on our terms, or someone's else's definition of life?"
15013,2020-07-31 06:23:52+00:00,warikoo,"""Would I regret not doing this 10 years from now?""

Humans are hardwired for short-term thinking.
And that inhibits our ability to think in decades and compare it with today.

If only we asked this question more often, we would see a lot less regret in old people. Our own selves."
15014,2020-07-31 06:23:51+00:00,warikoo,"""Do I need to, have to, or want to?""

Going to the depth of the reason behind our actions tells us so much about our own selves.

Do we operate out of obligation (have to), lack of choice (need to) or desire (want to)?"
15015,2020-07-31 06:23:51+00:00,warikoo,"""Who would I be without this thought?""

For all the times that we hate ourselves, blame ourselves, doubt ourselves, this question is a powerful way to imagine us without these feelings, without these thoughts.

How would you behave, how would you operate, without these thoughts?"
15016,2020-07-31 06:23:50+00:00,warikoo,"""Why am I feeling this way?""

It is crazy that we actually try to stop feeling what we feel. We tell ourselves not to be angry, not to be jealous, not to suspect, not to be scared.

But we rarely stop to ask this question.
Baffles me, the lack of genuine curiosity."
15017,2020-07-31 06:23:50+00:00,warikoo,"""What is the most important thing for me in life, right now?""

Here is the thing about humans
If we do not know what is the one thing we want from life right now, the next best thing we want is EVERYTHING.

And that is a disaster."
15018,2020-07-31 06:23:49+00:00,warikoo,"""What is this telling me?""

When things don't work out, it is easy to crib, complain, find excuses or find faults.
Consider asking this question instead.

And suddenly, the shift in frame of reference, opens doors of realization."
15019,2020-07-31 06:23:48+00:00,warikoo,"""What are we optimizing for?""

What is the one thing that we want to fix/change/improve, by our action.

Just one thing.
Not two. Not three.
One thing.

Give me that one metric and I know what you want.
Give me more than one, and I know you think you know what you want!"
15020,2020-07-31 06:23:48+00:00,warikoo,"""Start with why"" was just another way of saying, ""Start with a question""

Here are some questions that have helped me tremendously, over the past decade, as an entrepreneur, a  leader, a father, a husband, a friend and all other roles I have played."

Brilliant people don't solve problems.
They ask questions.
And the questions then solve the problems."

Worse still, solve it fast! 

We take fast problem solving to be a reflection of our intelligence."

15310,2020-07-17 05:33:51+00:00,warikoo,"Find your intersection of ""what you love"" and ""what you are good at""
And devote 3-5 years towards it.
With NO pressure of making money off it.
Just for the joy of it
For the love of it.

At some point, you will unlock value.
It is inevitable, if you have devoted yourself to it."
15311,2020-07-17 05:33:50+00:00,warikoo,"5. While living your current life (whatever it is), work on this intersection and slowly mold it to what the world needs. 
This is going to be hard, long drawn, and will require discipline.

You are converting your passion into ""Delight and fullness, but no wealth"""
15312,2020-07-17 05:33:50+00:00,warikoo,"4. Of the intersection, ask yourself, ""Which of these does the world need, or can need if I change the current scale/scope/form of it?""

For instance, you love singing and are good at it. The world doesn't need your singing. But it needs singers."
15313,2020-07-17 05:33:49+00:00,warikoo,"1. Make a laundry list of things that you are good at
2. Make a laundry list of things that you love doing
3. Find the intersection
3a. If none, go back to your childhood / early days and recollect things that made people wonder ""how did you do that?"". Dig deep and far back."
15314,2020-07-17 05:33:48+00:00,warikoo,"Once understood, the next logical question is: How to arrive at your Ikigai.

Several books and prescriptions exist out there.
Most of them delve into what I consider ""on the surface"" prescriptions.

Here is what worked for me..."
15315,2020-07-17 05:33:48+00:00,warikoo,"It is this critical nuance that most people miss when navigating through the concept of Ikigai.

The meaning of your life, is the intersection of ALL 4 things, not 3 or 2.
And understanding what the intersection of 3/2 circles means, brings us closer to the meaning of Ikigai."
15316,2020-07-17 05:33:47+00:00,warikoo,"This, imo, is the true power of Ikigai.

Explaining a situation that is close to Ikigai that we may be tricked to believing we are living it, when the truth is we aren't.

It explained to me why I felt uselessness while in consulting, why I felt empty while at Groupon."

15318,2020-07-17 05:33:46+00:00,warikoo,"However, most people, when digging into the concept of Ikigai, stop at this image and understanding.

I realized, it wasn't so much the intersection of all 4 circles that was interesting, it was the intersection of 3 or lesser circles that explained what I had felt in life so far"
15319,2020-07-17 05:33:45+00:00,warikoo,"People work odd jobs just to pay their bills. They don't love it. Nor are they necessarily good at it. 
They are living out a vocation.
Not their Ikigai."
15320,2020-07-17 05:33:44+00:00,warikoo,"People pursue their hobbies, something that they love and are good at, but it never ends up making any money and it probably isnt what the world cares about - that's living out their passion.
Not their Ikigai."
15321,2020-07-17 05:33:44+00:00,warikoo,"Volunteers, who help out on something the world needs and something they love doing, but are not paid enough or maybe aren't even good at what they do - are living their mission.
Not their Ikigai."
15322,2020-07-17 05:33:43+00:00,warikoo,"The concept is so powerful

The endless number of people in jobs that they are good at and are paid for - are simply living a profession. 
Not their Ikigai."
15323,2020-07-17 05:33:43+00:00,warikoo,"What you can be paid for is YOUR definition of money (and thus the quantum of it).

I may feel happy getting paid much lower than my peers and that suffices for me
Or I may think that I need to be paid atleast this much else it work for me."
15324,2020-07-17 05:33:42+00:00,warikoo,"The personal definition is critical, especially when it comes to ""What the world needs"" and ""What you can be paid for""

I felt that the world doesn't need consulting. 
That is MY view.
Not the world's view.

Everything that exists in the world exists because someone needs it."
15325,2020-07-17 05:33:41+00:00,warikoo,"Its an elegant concept.

YOUR reason of being is the intersection of
1. What you are good at
2. What you love
3. What the world needs
4. What you can be paid for

The operating word here, that's largely missed, is

15578,2020-07-03 06:53:56+00:00,warikoo,"Here is something I have never admitted in public

I often feel sad that nearbuy is not a success, in the socially accepted definition of success. 
You know - unicorn and shit.
Because it often leads people to believe that this form of leadership and culture building doesn't work"
15579,2020-07-03 06:53:55+00:00,warikoo,"And that stemmed from the belief that setting the right culture is no one's except the leader's responsibility.

15588,2020-07-03 06:52:41+00:00,warikoo,"And that's what we did.
We built our culture on the foundation of anonymity.
And obsessive transparency.

Anonymity + Transparency 

Which made us consistent in our actions. And predictable.

And thus gave people the most important thing we all care for..."
15589,2020-07-03 06:52:41+00:00,warikoo,"I care about the truth.
Not the source of the truth.

I care about what needs to be fixed, or improved, or challenged.
I do not care about who feels this way or said it.

What we needed was anonymity."

Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.

AHA! 
This was it."
15591,2020-07-03 06:52:40+00:00,warikoo,"And I realized why.
We are not the West.
We are India.
We are culturally very different.

We are trained to be complaint. To be subservient. To not question authority.

We are fearful of the reactions to our feedback."
15592,2020-07-03 06:52:40+00:00,warikoo,"..and because of this feedback will flow. People will share what is right, what is wrong. Will make each other better.

And so we did that. Built really nice happy offices. Kept saying, ""our doors are open. talk to us whenever you want""

Nothing happened..."
15593,2020-07-03 06:52:39+00:00,warikoo,"But before that, a short side story...

2. Exhibit it daily.

There is only one thing that mattered - did you achieve what you had set out to do."

No one told him to do it."

This is precious. 
Not something that money can buy."
15598,2020-07-03 06:52:36+00:00,warikoo,"OWNERSHIP
Ownership isn't doing what you are supposed to do. That's your job. That's what you are paid for. 

Ownership is going beyond.
It means not taking what the organization lays out for you, as the only benchmark. Instead finding your own levels and benchmarks."
15599,2020-07-03 06:52:36+00:00,warikoo,"Respect does not come from titles.

It doesn't matter who you are, how you look, how much you earn, how you speak, where you studied, what your title is or how long have you been with us. 
You will be respected.
And you will respect everyone accordingly.

How are they made to feel, at the end of everyday.

And that comes down to this rather hard to explain thing called culture.

It is culture that dictates how people operate, how they behave and how they feel."
15605,2020-07-03 06:52:33+00:00,warikoo,"And in my experience, the money, the title, the position and even the responsibility to some extent, very quickly becomes commonplace. 

It becomes oxygen - something critical, but we don't acknowledge it every second. Its just there.

16312,2020-05-15 05:58:00+00:00,warikoo,"And I had just come out of a broken relationship with Physics, where I thought I was in love with it, but I clearly wasn't. 

I remember my ENTIRE world telling me that coming back was fucked up and the worst decision ever.
But I didn't feel that. Not for a moment."

Day 1 job, you are successful
Top 10% of the class, you are successful
A 3X multiple on your incoming salary, you are successful
GF/BF in the first week, you are successful
Dress well, speak well, you are successful"
16314,2020-05-15 05:57:59+00:00,warikoo,"But what I remember most out of that experience was how, from the very first day, the definition of success was already decided for all of us."
16315,2020-05-15 05:57:58+00:00,warikoo,"Because I didn't got to ISB looking for a job, or a career, or a company or a title. 

I went there looking for myself. 
Who the fuck am I?
What am I good at?
What makes me happy?
What could I possibly be doing?
And what should I not do?"
16316,2020-05-15 05:57:58+00:00,warikoo,"And so I applied. 
And thankfully got through (till date don't know why)

And that 1-yr just fundamentally changed me. 
In every possible manner."
16317,2020-05-15 05:57:57+00:00,warikoo,"Only 5 years old.
Expensive as fuck!
BUT
A 1-yr MBA
And a bunch of work experienced professionals coming together. 

For someone, whose entire worldview was limited to Einstein, Newton and Archimedes, THIS was the shit. 

Spend time with people who had done stuff for real."
16318,2020-05-15 05:57:56+00:00,warikoo,"I wasn't sure.
2 years sounded too much of an investment - time and money. 
Especially since I didn't know if an MBA was for me. 

And then pure serendipity, I got to know of @ISBedu"
16319,2020-05-15 05:57:56+00:00,warikoo,"And my friends were like, ""Look you are confused. So why don't you do what most confused people do?

Go, get an MBA!"""
16320,2020-05-15 05:57:55+00:00,warikoo,"I had no plans. 
No clue what I should be doing in life. 
No idea on how to even figure it out. 

I was clearly a failure. 
When my friends from school/college were in jobs, some of them even married, I was jobless, aimless, goalless."
16321,2020-05-15 05:57:55+00:00,warikoo,"At the age of 24, I dropped out of my PhD program in the US and came back to India. 

Because I figured that I was good at Physics.
But it didn't make me happy.

For the first time it struck me that if you are good at something it doesn't automatically make you happy doing it."

You wanted to be happy doing it, feel fulfilled being one, desired peace from it.
Or whatever else was it.

Because that is the only thing the matters.
Fuck the market. Do what is right for you."

Forbes list - success
Shut down - failure
Not growing - failure

You will live someone's life, unless you realize it. 
And start living yours."

The stapler not working - your fault.
People leaving - your fault.
Office is far for people - your fault.
You are not growing - your fault.
You will share credit for all the good things.
And kill yourself within for all the things gone wrong."

You'll think they have come for solutions. 
No - they have come with problems. 
But you will burden yourself with the search of the solution.
And if you don't find it, which most likely you won't, you will knowingly offer a lousy solution."
16599,2020-04-24 07:53:00+00:00,warikoo,"You will have to layoff people. At some point. 
And tell you what - it will be your fucking fault.

And then he runs the race. And wins.

It is the journey you have to fall in love with. There is no destination!"
16601,2020-04-24 07:52:59+00:00,warikoo,"Entrepreneurship is fucking hard. 
The early excitement of building a team, planning a name, launching the first version will fade away.
 
And insane details that life has, will begin to emerge.
At that point, there is only one thing that will help.
The stories you tell yourself."
16602,2020-04-24 07:52:59+00:00,warikoo,"Your emotional and mental state as a founder has a direct impact on your startup. 
 
People see that you are anxious. 
They know when you are depressed.
Don't pretend to wear red underwear over your pants. 
Act human. Be human.

16604,2020-04-24 07:52:58+00:00,warikoo,"you won't know when precisely.

16606,2020-04-24 07:52:57+00:00,warikoo,"As a founder, the only time you are called successful is when you take unpopular decisions and they work out. 

Taking popular decisions is ""easy"". 
And If your decisions don't work out, then you are as it is good for nothing.
 
That's massive odds against you."

But a good team can't make a bad market work. 

The market is (almost) everything."
16608,2020-04-24 07:52:56+00:00,warikoo,"Investors are in the business of entering and exiting businesses. 
They are not in the business of making your business work. 
If entering your business works for them, they will enter. But they will also eventually exit. 
They NEED to exit. 
That's the business they are in."
16609,2020-04-24 07:52:55+00:00,warikoo,"As a founder, you are a celebrity, whether you like it or not. 

Every word you speak will be analyzed, every action of yours will be reproduced, every standard you allow will set a new standard. 
Think of how you speak, how you act and the standards you accept."
16610,2020-04-24 07:52:55+00:00,warikoo,"The market is the market! 
It doesn't care about who you are, as a founder. Which school you went to. What you have given up to get to this point. 

And that is hard hitting for a lot of people who are used to things working their way because of where they come from in life."
16611,2020-04-24 07:52:54+00:00,warikoo,"When was the last time you bought a product or service, because the founder is from IIT, or because the founder hasn't drawn a salary for the past 6 months, or that the founder is going through depression?

17903,2019-08-04 09:06:38+00:00,warikoo,"@GabbbarSingh Technically the Uber surge pricing is purely to balance demand and supply. 

The driver‚Äôs app shows the surge according to area. If every drives moves to that area to make more money, the supply increase and surge goes away. Works mostly, except exponential demand situations."
17904,2019-08-04 05:32:04+00:00,warikoo,"@GabbbarSingh Made aware of a unexpected and unpredictable demand curve. They should and could have stopped the pricing algo. 

However, most such crisis don‚Äôt come with a forewarning (Mumbai rains and Uber surge, for example)

And by the time it‚Äôs fixed, there is 1 instance to make ‚Äúnews‚Äù."
17905,2019-08-04 05:30:21+00:00,warikoo,"@GabbbarSingh So the only way to prevent this is to know the demand curve in advance (read, impossible mostly) or to not have a price Algo in place (which is what you are hinting towards).

In case of Srinagar rn, that should have been the case. All airlines were instantly &amp; simultaneously

17906,2019-08-04 05:29:00+00:00,warikoo,"@GabbbarSingh By the time the systems realize that demand has gone through the roof (during a crisis), it‚Äôs usually very late. By that time the damage has been done. 
The price will be unreasonable. The surge will be crazy! There will always be at least 1 instance of a curve exception. 
2/n"
17907,2019-08-04 05:27:46+00:00,warikoo,"@GabbbarSingh This is a classic marketplace pricing situation. 
Demand curves during ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù can be exponential in nature. Like the demand for tickets in Srinagar right now can zoom up in virtually seconds. 
Pricing algorithms are rarely exponential. For obvious reasons.
